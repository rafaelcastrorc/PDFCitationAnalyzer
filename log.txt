Found CASE 2 (du-
ration of vegetative and reproductive phase, budding 
and flowering, tuber mass, tuber number and yield 
per plant), which confirms the existence of genetic 
variability among accessions.
Most of the analyzed accessions originated 
from Montenegro. By analyzing the influence of day 
length on flowering initiation and the length of the 
vegetative phase, it was found that their variability 
was lower than in accessions from the uSA and cul-
tivars. Accessions originating from the uSA can be 
considered as typical representatives of the species 
from its natural habitat and the center of origin. That 
is why it could be expected for them to show greater 
variability than a group of accessions that after in-
troduction, remained on the relatively small area of 
Montenegro (Dozet et al., 1993; vasić et al., 2002)

Found CASE 2 (FMI) keeps producing
leaves with associated shoots after the transition to
reproductive development has occurred. This re-
view deals with the molecular mechanisms that
cause the reprogramming of primordia during this
transition. Most of the discussion will be focused
on Arabidopsis, but there will be reference to work

Found CASE 2 (flowering time) and the determi-

1997)
Found CASE 2 (CEN),
the most likely ortholog in Antirrhinum, is only
expressed in the inflorescence meristem and reces-
sive mutations in this gene alter the determination
but not flowering time (Bradley et al., 1996)
Found CASE 2 (LF), which acts only as a
repressor of flowering, and DETERMINATE
(DET) which exclusively controls inflorescence
determination. The spatial expression pattern of
these genes has not been analyzed in detail, but
RT-PCR data show that LF is expressed both in
vegetative and inflorescence apices, while DET is
only expressed in inflorescence apices (Foucher
et al., 2003)

Considerations of floral termination and
plant architecture
Growth habit in plants is described by two fundamental
models, monopodial and sympodial. Both growth habits are
found in families of the most primitive plants, such as
liverworts, mosses, and cycads (Bell, 1992)

Found CASE 2 (see
later) balance flowering promoting signals, and regulators
of transmission per se, may also play a role. The rescue of
flowering, under short days, by wild-type donors may be
difficult in Arabidopsis as well, but in species where
efficient auto-regulation or relay-amplification mechanisms
evolved, uninduced wild-type donors may work.
SFT generates universal florigenic signals
Variations in responses to florigenic stimulus, presumably
due to different components of a mechanism shared by all
plants, or to independent ‘florigens’ operating differentially
in different plants (Bernier, 1988)

Found CASE 2 (Lifschitz E and Eshed
Y unpublished data). Thus, all responses stimulated by the
SFT to SP balance involve changes in growth, suggesting
that floral transition and growth attenuation, instead of
being the consequence of one another, are two facets of the
same cellular responses. Since all the facets of the SFT/SP
ratio are also graft-transmissible, it is speculated that
growth and termination are targets for florigen-compatible
signals and that boosting flowering is a pleiotropic effect of
FT orthologues (Lifschitz et al., 2006)

Found CASE 2 (FMs) that give rise to floral organs. As FMs arise in
response to multiple flowering signals and eventually differentiate
into various types of floral organ, the regulation of FM development

Found CASE 2 (donor) via a graft union to a non-

Found CASE 2 (flower-former) for this floral stimulus, which
he defined as specific substances with a regulatory function.
Grafting experiments between related species, but of a dif-
ferent photoperiodic response type (e.g., a short-day plant
[SDP] and a long-day plant [LDP]), provided evidence for ex-
changeability of florigen among different response types. This
earlier work showing that florigen is functionally conserved in
different species has been extensively reviewed (Lang, 1965;
Zeevaart, 1976)
Found CASE 2 (at least in closely related species and
different photoperiodic response types). However, despite
numerous attempts to extract florigen and several reports of
extracts with flower-inducing activity, which all turned out to be
nonreproducible, florigen remained a physiological concept
rather than a chemical entity. As a result, the florigen hypoth-
esis fell into disrepute, and a rival hypothesis, proposing that
flowering would be induced by a specific ratio of known
hormones and metabolites, gained favor (Bernier, 1988;
Bernier et al., 1993)
Found CASE 2 (GA) flowering response pathways (Mouradov et al.,
2002; Périlleux and Bernier, 2002; Komeda, 2004; Corbesier and
Coupland, 2005)
Found CASE 2 (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). CO encodes
a nuclear zinc-finger protein, which in response to LD induces
transcription of FT, encoding a RAF-kinase-inhibitor-like protein.
Neither of these genes is expressed to any extent in the shoot
apex. Expression from meristem-specific promoters of CO does
not promote flowering, but early flowering is induced in plants in
SD when FT is overexpressed in the meristem. Expression of CO
only in the phloem is sufficient to generate a phloem-mobile
signal, as shown by grafting experiments with Arabidopsis (An
et al., 2004; Ayre and Turgeon, 2004)

Found CASE 2 (at least in Arabidopsis). The objection can
be raised that FT itself is not the final stimulus, but only induces
another factor essential for flowering that moves along with FT
transcripts from leaf to shoot apex (An et al., 2004; Huang et al.,
2005; Wigge et al., 2005)

Found CASE 2 (Zeevaart, 1958)
Found CASE 2 (e.g.,
Xanthium strumarium and Bryophyllum daigremontianum) in
which flowering receptor shoots become effective donors
themselves. This phenomenon, called indirect induction or non-
localized induction, suggests that florigen has self-perpetuating
properties (for review, see Zeevaart, 1976)
Found CASE 2 (2005)
Found CASE 2 (below the graft union) is the donor, and the scion
(above the graft union) is the receptor. Arrows point toward the graft
unions. In each case, the appropriate photoperiodic conditions were
used to induce flowering of the donor plant, whereas the receptor was in
a noninductive photoperiod. None of the control grafts with noninduced
donors caused flowering in the receptors (data not shown).

Found CASE 2 (mRNA or protein) that is
required for flowering.
Little work on flowering has been performed with DNPs
because their flowering cannot be controlled at will. However,
recent work with tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) demonstrates
that flowering in this DNP is also induced by a transmissible
signal, generated by the ortholog of FT, SINGLE-FLOWER
TRUSS (SFT) (Lifschitz et al., 2006)
Found CASE 2 (Nicotiana tabacum) or tomato induced
early flowering in both species. Moreover, overexpression of
SFT induced flowering in the SDP Maryland Mammoth tobacco
in LD and in Arabidopsis under SD. Transmission of florigen via
grafts was obtained from tomato overexpressing SFT (donor) to
sft mutant plants, to MarylandMammoth tobacco in LD, and to a
tomato mutant uf that does not flower under low irradiance. SFT
was expressed in the leaves, and its protein wasmainly localized
in the nuclei of leaf cells. No evidence was obtained for
movement of SFT mRNA from donor leaves to receptor shoots,
so that it was proposed that in tomato, florigen is a signal
downstream of SFT (Lifschitz et al., 2006)
Found CASE 2 (if it crosses the graft union at all) and also that, unlike
in Arabidopsis (see above), an SFT autoregulatory loop does not
function in tomato. So, although there may be differences
between different species and photoperiodic response types, all
have in common that either FT, or a product of FT, is the flower-
inducing signal.
There are many examples of successful transmission of
florigen between different species (see above), but there are also
many examples in which the receptor shoots did not flower
(Zeevaart, 1976)

ments, it could be shown that in red Perilla and in B.

to produce sufficient florigen, whereas apical meristems of
juvenile plants can respond to florigen with flowering (Zeevaart,

Found CASE 2 (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa), and a
temperate origin grass, wheat (Triticum aestivum), pro-
vides most of the world’s food. Other grasses, such as
barley (Hordeum vulgare), ryegrass species (Lolium
spp.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and oats (Avena
sativa), are grown in lesser amounts, but also fill
important food production niches. In grass species,
such as sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), the vegetative
portion of the plant is harvested for the Suc that
accumulates in its stalks; in this crop, the inability to
flower is desirable because sugar levels drop after
plants make the transition to flowering as carbon
assimilates are shunted to seed production. In all of
these grasses, manipulation of the timing of the floral
transition is a vitally important trait in maximizing
yield potential. Extensive agronomic studies have
been done on grass species, but studies of the small
flowering dicot plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thali-
ana) have provided an abundance of information on
the genetic and molecular control of flowering. What
has emerged is a complex network of genes and
pathways, some parts of which are also found in the
grasses. Conversely, recent discoveries show that
grasses also have developed unique mechanisms to
regulate flowering.
RIGHT TIME, RIGHT PLACE: FEATURES OF THE
FLORAL TRANSITION
With regard to the floral transition, all higher plants
share some common mechanisms that control this
important switch fromvegetative to reproductive growth

Migration of crop grasses into different latitudes
required that they adopt other signals to induce
flowering so that they could adapt to different grow-
ing seasons. Because the underlying principle of
flowering time is the synchronization of the plant’s
internal rhythms with environmental conditions, al-
terations in daylength associated with seasonal
changes are among the most accurate cues to deter-
mine the right time to flower. In grasses, it is clear that
the core photoperiod response pathway is largely
conserved with Arabidopsis, albeit less well under-
stood (Laurie et al., 2004; Turck et al., 2008)

Found CASE 2 (i.e. vernalization). This is an adaptive
trait that prevents seeds sown in late summer or early
fall from flowering until the next spring, thereby
delaying flowering until the spring rather than just
before a possibly harsh winter. Analyses of mutants
that interfere with this vernalization response have
defined a separate pathway in the flowering model
(for review, see Sung and Amasino, 2005)
Found CASE 2 (FLC) gene has been identified as a
central flowering repressor whose activity is reduced
by vernalization. FLC encodes a MADS-box transcrip-
tion factor that represses flowering by directly inter-
fering with FT expression in leaves and FD expression

Found CASE 2 (sometimes all) of what would otherwise be vegetative
shoots into flowers. Most of these recent advances in
understanding flowering have come from the use of
molecular genetic techniques on annual plants, parti-
cularly Arabidopsis thaliana (commonly known as
Arabidopsis), which are well suited to this type of
investigation. Nevertheless, as the results obtained
from these plants have been extended to crop plants,
including perennials, it has become increasingly clear
that the formation of the structures that comprise a
typical flower, such as sepals, petals, stamens and
carpels, is largely conserved across all flowering
plants, with relatively minor variations in the activity
of key developmental genes accounting for the
observed variation in flower morphology (Goto et al.
2001, Smyth 2001)

The nature of this mobile flowering signal, often referred
to as florigen, has long been the subject of research.
Recent work in Arabidopsis has suggested that products
of the FLOWERING TIME (FT) gene may be at least part
of this mobile signal (Abe et al. 2005, Huang et al.

Found CASE 2 (QTL) Analysis for Photoperiodic
Flowering in RiceWhen researchers try to clone a gene from a mutant line by map‐based cloning,
extraQTLs in the segregating populationsmaymake it diYcult tomap the target
gene. This happened when researchers tried to clone the flowering‐time genes in
Arabidopsis because popular parent accessions such as Col andLer unexpectedly
contained major QTLs in vernalization pathways such as those for FLC and

Found CASE 2 (Table III). Typical short‐day plants, including
rice, represent one class. In this class, plants germinate in the spring and grow
during the summer; they initiate floral transition under appropriate daylength
conditions (i.e., time points in decreasing daylength) and flower in themiddle of
the summer so they can set seed in the autumn. In this class, control of the
amount of seed produced in each generation and the resulting local survival of
the species become feasible if the plant can prolong its vegetative phase asmuch
as possible in order to increase the biomass of individual plants and successfully
set seeds before winter. A second class includes winter‐annual Arabidopsis
ecotypes and winter‐annual wheat cultivars. In this class, plants germinate in
the late summer or autumn and grow well, but do not flower before vernaliza-
tion processes. During the winter, these plants become vernalized and able to
respond to environmental changes such as increasing temperature and day-
length in order to flower. When spring comes, the plants flower and set seed.
The third class includes summer‐annual Arabidopsis ecotypes and some wheat
cultivars. In this class, plants germinate in the spring and flower in the summer.
This class of plants may produce several generations in a year if growing
conditions permit, and survive the cold season mainly as seeds. When spring
comes, the increasingwarmthmay start germination. These three strategies and
the corresponding adaptation mechanisms are controlled by variousmolecular
mechanisms. Molecular genetics using rice and Arabidopsis has begun to pro-
vide a better understanding of how biodiversity at the molecular level allows
plants to adapt to diVerent growing conditions around the world. Further
studies of rice will provide some of themissing details of themolecularmechan-
isms in this species and will let it serve as a model plant that provides further
insights into other species in the short‐day class.ReferencesAbe, M., Kobayashi, Y., Yamamoto, S., Daimon, Y., Yamaguchi, A., Ikeda, Y., Ichinoki, H.,

Found CASE 2 (Ka)/synonymous substitutions (Ks) analyses. Their retention was mainly due to the high
percentages of expression divergence. Our data also showed that this gene family might play a role in
multiple developmental stages and tissues and might be regarded as important regulators of various
abiotic stresses and sugar signaling.

Found CASE 2 (ATPase family associated with various
cellular activities). Thus, the bZIP domain-containing protein
in some Archaea species may have evolved into additional
functions or may have lost the TF function. On the other hand,
since only one member could be detected in some species
from Archaea, the common ancestor among eukaryotes and
prokaryotes may have only a single bZIP gene. Furthermore,
the primitive eukaryote Giardia lamblia also encodes only one
bZIP member (Deppmann et al. 2006)

Found CASE 2 (TE)-related bZIP
genes
We have investigated the contribution of both retrotransposons
and DNA transposons to the expansion of bZIP genes. To
detect possible retrogenes in the bZIP family, amino acid
sequences from single exon bZIP genes were subjected to
BLASTP searches against all of the remaining bZIP TFs
with two or more exon-containing coding sequences in their
corresponding genes. Retrogenes were identified according to
the criteria (Wang et al. 2006)

Found CASE 2 (SD) plant, Perilla crispa (synonym Perilla

characterized as an irreversible and indestructive
phenomenon (Zeevaart 1958, 1969)
Found CASE 2 (L.) Britton var. crispa (Thunb. ex Murray) Decne. ex
L. H. Bailey were used as the experimental materials.
The nomenclature of Perilla is confusing, and the same

P. frutescens, P. ocymoides, or P. nankinensis in the
past literature on flowering (Zeevaart 1986)

Found CASE 2 (e.g., when the central leader is damaged)
are a few spurs able to overcome the apical dominance and
grow out. The lower levels of GA might inhibit long
extension growth and are related to the dwarfing of most
columnar trees.
Transcriptome analyses of columnar type apple trees
Another approach to unravel the function of Co is the
analysis of transcriptional changes in columnar compared
to normal type apple trees. Taking into consideration of the
fundamental phenotypic changes, it can be expected that
the expression levels of several genes are altered, but it is
difficult to decide on one specific pathway which is defi-
nitely influenced, so the method of choice is a whole
transcriptome study.
Three recent studies have analyzed the transcriptomes of
columnar and normal type apple trees via RNA-seq. Zhang
et al. (2012)

Found CASE 2 (through the LFR response), and PHYA for germination of
insensitive seeds (through VLFR) and negatively photoblastic seed
germination through HIR.
When a seedling emerges from the seed coat, it is located
underground. When it protrudes from the ground, it gains access to
light. Then a de-etiolation process rapidly takes place, mainly
under the dependence of PHYB through the LFR pathway when R
light is abundant (Franklin and Quail, 2010)

Found CASE 2 (s) that migrates from leaves to apical meristem to initiate flowering – was
notoriously elusive, having made it almost the “Bigfoot” of plant biology. There was never a lack of drama in the field
of florigen study, and florigen researchers have once again experienced such a swing in the last two years. We wrote a
minireview last year in this journal (Yu et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (FT) mRNA might be the molecular form of a florigen. However, this hypothesis was challenged in a little less than
two years after its initial proposition, and the original paper proposed that the FT mRNA hypothesis was retracted (Huang

of a Maryland Mammoth receiver induced flowering in the tobacco
receiver (arrow) grown under long-day conditions. The photographs
were reproduced from (Lifschitz et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (CONSTANS) and the rat glucocorticoid receptor
(GR). GR is well known for its conditional nuclear localization ac-
tivity. Transgenically expressed GR-fusion proteins reside in the
cytosol of Arabidopsis cells, whereas they are translocated into
the nucleus in the presence of corticosteroid hormones or the
synthetic analog, dexamethasone (dex) (Lloyd et al. 1994)

Flowering is a phase transition from vegetative to reproduc-
tive growth in higher plants, and is controlled by vernaliza-
tion, photoperiod, and autonomous genetic pathways

Found CASE 2 (Arabidopsis thaliana) and var-

material on which the current genetic regulatory frame-
work of flowering has been built (Simpson and Dean
2002)
Found CASE 2 (Pisum sativum), flowering-related
mutants have been extensively used in grafting experi-
ments to show the genetic control of production and
perception of graft-transmissible signals in flowering

Found CASE 2 (one shoot scion on a root stock) was used to inves-
tigate communication between roots and shoots. In some
reports, alternative strategies, such as a local gene-
expression system and grafting using other plant species
that are more amenable to grafting, were used to investi-
gate shoot-to-shoot communication. This may be due to the
difficulties in assembling and establishing two-shoot Y-
shaped grafts (two stock and scion shoots on a stock root
system), as reflected by the small numbers of plants used in
these experiments. Actually, only a small number of suc-
cessful grafts were obtained using the original method in
preliminary trials. In addition, at what point the connection
of vasculature is established at a graft junction was not
analyzed in any previous report (Turnbull et al. 2002)

induced if the plant shows a LD response, or repressed
in the case of a SD plant. A number of years later,
Pittendrigh, working on insects, introduced a new turn
in Bünning’s postulates and proposed the external
coincidence model that includes the role of light in
entraining the clock to the solar cycle to explain photo-
periodic responses (Bünning, 1960; Pittendrigh and
Minis, 1964)

Found CASE 2 (s)
that is generated in the leaves in response to photo-
periodic inductive conditions and moves through the
phloem to stimulate the initiation of flowering in the shoot
apical meristem (SAM). The florigen was proposed to
be a universal signal that could induce flowering in
grafts of different species, even if they display diverse
photoperiodic responses. The nature of this substance
has remained elusive for decades, despite the effort
dedicated to its characterization.
In this review we discuss recent progress in identifying
components involved in regulating the photoperiodic
control of flowering; much of these advances come
from analyses performed in the model species Arabi-
dopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), a LD plant, and rice
(Oryza sativa), a SD plant (Yanovsky and Kay, 2003;
Hayama and Coupland, 2004; Searle and Coupland,
2004; Corbesier and Coupland, 2005; Imaizumi and
Kay, 2006)
Found CASE 2 (Solanum lycopersicum) and Pharbitis nil has
begun to be analyzed and is briefly summarised (Hayama
et al., 2007; Mizoguchi et al., 2007)
Found CASE 2 (CO) expression and stability
by the circadian clock and several photoreceptors, and
that provide the molecular basis for our current under-
standing of the external coincidence model in the control
of photoperiodic flowering (Yanovsky and Kay, 2002;
Valverde et al., 2004; Imaizumi et al., 2005; Sawa et
al., 2007)
Found CASE 2 (FLOWERING LOCUS T) in this process,
as well as its proposed role as an essential component
of the florigen (Lifschitz et al., 2006; Corbesier et al.,
2007; Jaeger and Wigge, 2007; Kobayashi and Weigel,

with PHYA playing the most prominent role in LD per-

when grown in SD conditions that are extended for
several hours with incandescent light, enriched in far-
red light that promotes flowering (Johnson et al.,

Found CASE 2 (ran-
dom ampliWed polymorphic DNA), AFLP (ampliWed

fragment length polymorphism) markers within
tobacco has limited their usefulness for mapping genes
of N. tabacum origin. In crops such as tomato and rice,
near isogenic lines (NILs) or introgression lines (ILs)
possessing small segments of a wild relative’s genome
within the genome of the cultivated species have been
useful for introducing DNA polymorphism, facilitating
identiWcation of favorable exotic alleles, and for dis-
secting corresponding quantitative trait loci (QTLs)

continued genetic modiWcation of the cultivated species.
Materials and methods
Plant materials
The genetic stock Red Russian MlMl was created by
transferring an introgressed chromosome region origi-
nating from N. tomentosa to germplasm line Red Rus-
sian (hereafter referred to as Red Russian mlml) using
an unreported number of backcrosses (Clausen and
Cameron 1944)
Found CASE 2 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC). Entries were considered as Wxed factors
and years were considered as random. Entry means
were calculated using the LSMEANS statement.
PROC CORR was used to calculate Pearson correla-
tion coeYcients between measured traits. The genetic
eVects of the introgressed region on the measured
traits within the Red Russian genetic background were
estimated using entry means according to Edwards
et al. (1987)
Found CASE 2 (2007)

Found CASE 2 (LI-COR, Lin-

Tomato is now one of the most popular vegetables and one 
of the most important fruit crops in the world. No horticul-
tural crop has received more attention and detailed study 
than tomato which became a model crop for many experi-
mental investigations. Knowledge and information gathered 
from these works have furthered our understanding of 
flowering in this species. An abundance of applied and fun-
damental studies, devoted to the development of the flower 
up to anthesis and of the fruit, have been published, thanks 
to the economic importance of tomato. They have been 
summarized on several occasions (Picken et al. 1985; 
Picken and Grimmett 1986; Kinet and Peet 1997)
Found CASE 2 (Calvert 
1965; Sawhney and Greyson 1972; Ecole 1974)
Found CASE 2 (SAM), before the first inflorescence, constitutes the initial 
segment. Additional stem portions, between inflorescences, 
are called the sympodial segments; they are produced by 
precociously activated axillary meristems, referred to as 
‘sympodial meristems’. Activation of axillary and sympo-
dial meristems is regulated differently since mutations in 
the LATERAL SUPPRESSOR (LS) gene that inhibits axil-
lary shoot outgrowth do not prevent sympodial growth 
(Schumacher et al. 1995, 1999; Schmitz et al. 2002; Szym-
kowiak and Irish 2006)
Found CASE 2 (SP) regulates the sympo-
dial development by controlling the regularity of the vege-
tative-reproductive switch of the different sympodial seg-
ments (Pnueli et al. 1998)

cence meristem identity genes (Pnueli et al. 1998)

Found CASE 2 (FT) which has been 
shown to be a major integrator of the genetic pathways to 
flowering. The FT product represents a part of the long dis-
tance signal(s) generated in cotyledons and leaves and ac-
ting at the shoot apex to trigger floral transition (Abe et al. 
2005; Huang et al. 2005)

Found CASE 2 (FA), 
SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) and, in a lesser extent, 
JOINTLESS (J) and BLIND (BL) could act as regulatory 
components of a promotion autonomous pathway.  
The sft and fa mutations produce a late flowering phe-
notype in both long-day and short-day conditions and the 
combination of both mutations completely block the transi-
tion to flowering (Molinero-Rosales et al. 1999, 2004)
Found CASE 2 (LFY) 
and Anthirrinum majus FLORICAULA (FLO) genes; all 
three genes are acting as floral identity genes (see following 
section). As fa, the lfy mutant shows a late flowering phe-
notype (Blazquez et al. 1997)

Found CASE 2 (see below), are 
impaired, increasing the chance of flowering inhibition 
during each successive sympodial phase. Molinero-Rosales 
et al. (2004)
Found CASE 2 (2006)
Found CASE 2 (Dielen et al. 2004)
Found CASE 2 (1998, see 
below), flowering time of the sympodial and of the initial 
segments of tomato is not regulated in the same way. In the 
uf mutant and the double mutants, genes affecting the 
flowering time of the sympodial segments could thus be ac-
tivated after the first partial floral evocation, a process 
which could be reiterated, even if the plants had not initiated 
flowers. 
Although SP has been reported not to be involved in the 
regulation of floral transition of the initial segment (Pnueli 
et al. 1998)

Found CASE 2 (see below), hence all 
three acting necessarily downstream of a gene which regu-
lates the production of an inflorescence meristem. The SP 
gene has been reported not to be implicated in the regu-
lation of the reproductive structure development (Pnueli et 
al. 1998)

Found CASE 2 (S), FALSIFLORA (FA) and ANANTHA 
(AN) have already been described in section III of this 
review, devoted to the ‘inflorescence architecture’. They 
produce inflorescences either bearing numerous flowers due 
to a repeated branching of the reproductive structure, as in s 
(Quinet et al. 2006b)
Found CASE 2 (Allen 
and Sussex 1996)
Found CASE 2 (lfi), was shown to 
be allelic to fa. The lfi mutant shows a less strong phenotype

Found CASE 2 (Vaccinium spp.), floral buds are usually initiated
during the growing season, enter dormancy during late
summer or fall, and then flower the following spring after
satisfying their chilling requirements and return to favorable
growth conditions. Sufficient vernalization is a prerequisite
for normal plant growth and synchronized flowering during
their life cycle. There is no question about the significant
economic importance of normal floral bud initiation,
obtaining adequate chilling, and subsequent flowering in
tree and shrub fruit production (Wilkie et al. 2008)
Found CASE 2 (for the southern
US) and good cold tolerance (for the northern and midwestern
US) are among the high priorities for blueberry breeding. So far,
little research has been conducted to investigate the molecular
genetic basis of flowering in blueberry.
To date, we have developed reliable transformation
tools for blueberry cultivars (Song and Sink 2004, 2006;
Walworth et al. 2012)

altered plant architecture and dormancy requirement
(Srinivasan et al. 2012)
Found CASE 2 (CO)-like gene
mainly responds to inductive photoperiod and FLC-like
gene is regulated by autonomous control and vernalization
(Hsu et al. 2011; Pin 2012; Posé et al. 2012)
Found CASE 2 (s) and LFY-
like(s) following overexpression of the VcFT in transgenic
blueberry plants will help to elucidate the interactions of
major floral genes in blueberry. In P. trichocarpa, two FT-
like genes were identified possibly due to ancient genome
duplication (Hsu et al. 2006, 2011)

et al., 2004a, 2004b; Ohara et al., 2003)
Found CASE 2 (GES) gene in mature tomato fruit caused
marked changes in the volatile composition, along with
unexpected increases of myrcene, limonene, and
ocimene (Davidovich-Rikanati et al., 2007)
Found CASE 2 (Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf), sour
orange (Citrus aurantium L.), and rough lemon (Citrus
jambhiri Lush.) were used in these experiments. Plants
were cultivated at the National Institute of Fruit Tree
Science (NIFTS), Okitsu Citrus Research Station,
Shizuoka, Japan. Trifoliate orange was used as the source
for transformation experiments. Sour orange was used
as the first rootstock for the in vitro grafting of
regenerated shoots. Rough lemon was used as the second
rootstock for the second grafting of trifoliate orange on
sour orange. Seeds from all species were germinated and
grown as described previously (Endo et al., 2005)

Found CASE 2 (E)-β-ocimene/β-myrcene
was low compared to that in the flowers. A difference
in the (E)-β-ocimene content was also observed in
satsuma mandarin, where (E)-β-ocimene was compara-
tively abundant in flowers and then decreased as the
fruit developed (Shimada et al., 2005a)

also promote flowering by regulation of flowering time genes
in the leaf, and potentially by systemic transport and direct
action in the shoot apical meristem (D’Aloia et al. 2011)

Found CASE 2 (2014)
Found CASE 2 (Malus×domestica Borkh.) is among the most 
popular fruit trees and is an important commercial fruit 
crop in temperate areas of the world. Many researchers 
have sought to improve fruit size, fruit skin color, 
disease resistance and taste. Molecular-based breeding 
techniques have been applied increasingly to woody 
plants. In many cases, research based on model plants, 
such as Arabidopsis and rice, has been done woody 
plants because both herbaceous and woody plants share 
biological and developmental phenomena that are often 
regulated by the same molecular mechanism. However, 
woody plants are distinct from herbaceous plants in 
possessing a much longer juvenile period in their life 
history. Herbaceous plants tend to adjust their life history 
by adaptation to environmental conditions. Conversely, 
woody plants depend on internal physiology, nutrition 
and phytohormones to regulate their development.
The multi-year delay in the onset of flowering in 
woody plants hampers their breeding. To shorten the 
long generation time, researchers have sought to identify 
flowering genes in apple. The Arabidopsis LEAFY gene

Found CASE 2 (FT) gene of Arabidopsis 
is well known as a floral activator and the coding protein 
is transported from leaves to the shoot apex as a floral 
initiation signal, termed ‘florigen.’ Orthologs of FT in 
other herbaceous and woody plant species are highly 
conserved and promote flowering in the respective plants

However, a recent report has provided genetic evidence that GAs are involved in 
regulating flowering in grapevines, since an early flowering dwarfed mutant has 
been found to be deficient in the grapevine homolog of the Arabidopsis gene GAI, 
involved in the GA signaling pathway (Boss and Thomas, 2002)
Found CASE 2 (the critical 
daylength), plants respond by initiating growth cessation, marked by a reduction in 
internode elongation followed by the formation of terminal buds (autumn buds). 
During the first weeks of short days, all primordia developed before the onset of 
short days will develop into leaves, and the last primordia formed before the onset 
of short days is the last leaf to mature, often not to full size (Rohde et al., 2002)

Plant transformation 
 
Various methods can be used for transferring genes into a plant’s genome. One of 
the most commonly used is Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer. Populus 
transformation is performed by soaking stem segments in an Agrobacterium 
solution, allowing the cut ends of the stem segments to be infected. The stem 
segments are then placed on media containing growth hormones to stimulate shoot 
formation and antibiotics to select transformed shoots (Nilsson et al., 1992)

Found CASE 2 (Garner and Allard 1920)
Found CASE 2 (1920)
Found CASE 2 (Mizoguchi et al. 2002, 2005)
Found CASE 2 (Schaffer et al. 1998; Mizoguchi et al. 2002; Wang and
Tobin 1998;). Two floral activator genes, GIGANTEA
(GI) and CONSTANS (CO), play key roles in
photoperiodic flowering (Fowler et al. 1999; Park et al.
1999; Putterill et al. 1995)
Found CASE 2 (FT ) and promotes flowering in
Arabidopsis (Mizoguchi et al. 2005)
Found CASE 2 (Abe et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2005;
Wigge et al. 2005)
Found CASE 2 (LD), short-day
(SD) and day-neutral (DN) (Thomas and Vince-Prue
1997)
Found CASE 2 (2007)
Found CASE 2 (Koornneef et al. 1991)
Found CASE 2 (CO-ox) accelerates
flowering even under SD conditions (Simon et al. 1996)

Found CASE 2 (Mizoguchi
et al. 2002)
Found CASE 2 (Mizoguchi et al. 2005; Súarez-López et al. 2001)
Found CASE 2 (type
III). WT, wild type. See text for details.
Almost all of the late and early flowering patterns
described above are well correlated with levels of FT
expression in Arabidopsis (Calvino et al. 2005; Fujiwara
et al. 2005a, b, c; Mizoguchi et al. 2005)
Found CASE 2 (high light or mild temperatures) (Samach
and Lotan 2006, this issue). This allows for the harvest
of tomato fruits over the entire year if temperatures in the
growth environment are high enough. How did the
ancestral tomato with the strong/mild photoperiodic
response type become day-neutral? Or did the ancestral
tomato has DN response type?
Day length affects a number of secondary compounds
in tomato cultivars. For example, in syn. Solanum
hirstum, levels of the steroidal glycoalkaloid tomatine
are different under LD than SD conditions at the same
irradiance (Sinden et al. 1978)
Found CASE 2 (Sinden et al. 1978)
Found CASE 2 (Chien and Sussex 1996;
Gianfagna et al. 1992)
Found CASE 2 (Mizoguchi et
al. 2000, 2006)
Found CASE 2 (SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS ; SFT ) delays flowering,
which indicates that SFT in tomato actually functions as
a floral activator in a manner similar to those in other
plant species such as Arabidopsis and rice (Lifschitz and
Eshed 2006; Lifschitz et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (Doi et al. 2004)
Found CASE 2 (Yamamoto et al. 2005)
Found CASE 2 (LD plant), rice (SD plant), and
tomato (DN plant) are important topics for future
investigations. The molecular mechanisms underlying
the DN flowering response in tomato have not been
elucidated. EMS-mutagenesis and generation of T-DNA
insertional lines of ‘Micro-Tom,’ which are currently
underway in our laboratory, will be useful in determining
these mechanisms.

Found CASE 2 (HOX) genes. This finding seemed at first a paradox and 
raised the question of how conserved genes can specify organisms with widely 
different morphologies. One possibility, which was put forward very early (King 
and Wilson 1975)
Found CASE 2 (evo-
devo), in both scientific and popular literature (e.g. Carroll 2005a; Carroll 
2005b)
Found CASE 2 (e.g., Prud'homme, Gompel, and Carroll 
2007; Wray 2007)
Found CASE 2 (proteins) has played an important role as well and 
argued that many of the cases that are cited as evidence for evolution via 
regulatory (cis) elements do not exclude alternative explanations (Hoekstra and 
Coyne 2007)
Found CASE 2 (e.g., Weberling 1989; Coen and Nugent 1994; Benlloch, Berbel, 
Serrano-Mislata, and Madueno 2007)
Found CASE 2 (indeterminate) 
apical meristem maintains its meristematic characteristics forming flowers or new 
inflorescence shoots on its flanks. Two examples of this are panicles and racemes 
(Arabidopsis and Antirhinum). In species with sympodial growth, the apical meristem 
terminates in a flower (determinate), which can be a solitary flower (e.g. tulip) or a 
cymose inflorescence bearing many flowers (e.g. petunia). The circles indicate 
flowers and the triangles indicate the apical meristems. 
 
Inflorescences can be divided into three major classes: racemes, cymes and 
panicles. In racemes flowers arise from lateral meristems, resulting in a straight 
(monopodial) axis. In cymes each axis terminates by forming a flower and a new 
axis forms in a lateral position that repeats this pattern. In panicles, all axes 
terminate in flowers. Each of these inflorescence types can be further divided 
into sub-classes based on differences in, for example, phylotactic patterns and 
lengths of internodes. 
 Recently, a theoretical model was put forward for the development and the 
evolution of distinct inflorescences (Prusinkiewicz, Erasmus, Lane, Harder, and 
Coen 2007)
Found CASE 2 (i.e., non-floral) identity, which enables 
them to generate a new metamer, but in time they lose their vegetative identity 
(or acquire floral identity) and terminate by forming a flower. If „vegetativeness‟ 
decreases with similar kinetics in apical and lateral meristems a panicle will be 
formed, but if it decreases more rapidly in apical or lateral meristems a cyme or 
raceme will be formed, respectively. Thus, changes in the spatio-temporal 
control of floral or non-floral meristem identity may, at least in theory, account 
for the three main inflorescence architectures (Prusinkiewicz et al. 2007)
Found CASE 2 (for reviews see: Jack 2004; 
Krizek and Fletcher 2005; Smyth 2005; Blazquez, Ferrandiz, Madueno, and Parcy 
2006)
Found CASE 2 (i.e., cymes and 
panicles), however, has not been studied in much detail, and hence the 
mechanisms that led to diversification of inflorescence architecture remain poorly 
understood (Benlloch et al. 2007; Koes 2008)
Found CASE 2 (photoperiod) is an important 
parameter by which plants measure progression through the seasons (Garner 
1922; Garner 1933)
Found CASE 2 (“long-day plants”) flower only when 
the light period (day) is longer than a critical threshold value; others when day-
length is shorter than the threshold (“short-day plants”); and yet others 
independently of day-length (“day-neutral plants”). Many plants species require 
in addition a cold period (winter) before they are capable of flowering, a 
phenomenon known as vernalization.  
 Not surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms that control flowering are best 
understood in Arabidopsis (for reviews see Mouradov, Cremer, and Coupland 
2002; Simpson and Dean 2002; Parcy 2005)
Found CASE 2 (LFY). FT is expressed in all organs and is 
regulated by the photoperiodic pathway and by ambient temperature (Kardailsky 
et al. 1999; Kobayashi, Kaya, Goto, Iwabuchi, and Araki 1999; Balasubramanian, 
Sureshkumar, Lempe, and Weigel 2006)

Found CASE 2 (Kusters et al. 
unplublished). Downregulation of PFG by RNA interference, in contrast, severely 
inhibited the switch from vegetative growth to flowering. In plants with a strong 
RNAi phenotype flowering was completely blocked, while lines with a weaker 
phenotype produced occasional flowers and then reverted to vegetative growth 
(Immink et al. 1999)

Found CASE 2 (DOT), because ubiquitous expression of DOT or its Arabidopsis homolog 
UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) in Petunia results in extremely early flowering 
(Souer et al. 2008)
Found CASE 2 (or anthoclades), each composed of a flower, a 
shoot that bears the next metamer, and two leaf-like organs named bracts or 
prophylls, with dormant shoots in their axils (Napoli and Ruehle 1996; Souer et

floral meristem and bract primordia, while the incipient IM is seen as a zone that 
lacks ALF expression (Souer et al. 1998)

Found CASE 2 (Prusinkiewicz 
et al. 2007)
Found CASE 2 (i) identity of the apical FM or the lateral IM or (ii) initiation and 
outgrowth of meristems and primordia. It is noteworthy that several genes that 
were initially classified as meristem identity genes, based on their mutant 
phenotypes, turned out to be involved in meristem initiation or proliferation and 
vice versa. Below the roles of these genes are discussed in more detail. 
 
Genes Specifying the Identity of the Floral Meristem. 
 Several mutants have been identified in which the apical FM fails to 
required for floral identity and instead develops as a lateral IM that will initiate 
two bracts and an additional lateral meristem. The endless reiteration of this 
program results a bushy inflorescence that contains only bracts and meristems 
but lacks flowers. The mutants aberrant leaf and flower (alf) and double top (dot) 
were identified by random transposon mutagenesis and display a nearly 
complete transformation of flowers into inflorescence shoots (Doodeman, Gerats, 
Schram, de Vlaming, and Bianchi 1984; Souer et al. 1998;  Souer et al. 2008)
Found CASE 2 (arb), with a very 
similar phenotype, but it remains unknown whether it represents an allele of ALF 
or DOT or an additional gene (Napoli and Ruehle 1996)

Found CASE 2 (or tomato), in part 
because they are not closely related, and will require analysis of a wider variety 
of species that diverged more recently. The extent to which the genes and 
alterations identified thus far can account for the evolution of distinct 
inflorescence structures can, in the end, be tested only by recreating the steps 
one-by-one in either a racemose (Arabidopsis) or cymose (Petunia) background. 
Such a test will comprise a fair evaluation of the extent to which these changes 
account for the observed anatomical divergence.

Found CASE 2 (season) 
and/or age of the plant when they switch from vegetative growth to flowering. 
The correct timed flowering is essential for the reproductive success and for the 
survival of the plant species as it assures that all individuals flower 
synchronously, which is essential for cross-fertilization, and enables the species 
to occupy a specific ecological niche. Flowering is controlled by environmental 
cues like day length (photoperiod), preceding cold (winter) periods 
(vernalization), ambient temperature, to monitor the progression of the seasons, 
as well as endogenous factors like hormones. These different flowering signals 
are perceived and transduced by distinct pathways that ultimately converge to 
activate a handful of genes, known as “integrators”, that promote the floral 
identity of meristems (Michaels, 2009; Turck et al., 2008)
Found CASE 2 (Benlloch et al., 2007; Koes, 2008; Prenner et al., 2009; 
Prusinkiewicz et al., 2007)
Found CASE 2 (meristems) are 
patterned. In panicles, which are for example common among cereals, both the 
apical and lateral meristems have initially a vegetative identity and at some point 
all acquire simultaneously floral identity. In cymes, which are common among 
Solanaceae (nightshades, which includes petunia and tomato), the apical 
meristem rapidly acquires floral identity and subsequently terminates by forming 
a flower, while at its periphery a lateral or „sympodial‟ inflorescence meristem 
(SIM) emerges, that will repeat the pattern by forming a new lateral SIM and an 
apical floral meristem (FM) (Lippman et al., 2008)

apical and lateral meristems lose their vegetativeness with the same kinetics. In 
a cyme, the apical meristem acquires floral identity more quickly than the lateral 
meristem, whereas in a raceme the apical meristem looses vegetativeness more 
slowly than lateral meristems (Prusinkiewicz et al., 2007)

Found CASE 2 (EVG), which encodes a transcription factor of the WUSCHEL 
homeobox (WOX) family, is exclusively expressed in the very young SIM and is 
thought to promote the proliferation of the SIM and the physical separation from 
the neighbouring apical FM (Rebocho, 2008)

(circle), malformed flower (circle with cross) and IM (black arrow). Normal wild type 
timed floral transition is indicated by a dotted line (…) and late floral transition is 
indicated by a dashed line (---). 
 
Role of VEGGIE in the onset of flowering 
Genetic experiments in Arabidopsis and petunia indicated that the activation of 
LFY or ALF is major factor determining the onset of flowering (Souer et al., 2008; 
Weigel et al., 1992)

Found CASE 2 (photoperiod) was early recognized as an important parameter 
by which plants measure seasonal changes (Garner, 1933; Garner, 1922)
Found CASE 2 (LD) plants such as Arabidopsis, wheat and barley flower in light periods 
longer than a certain threshold, whereas short-day (SD) plants such as rice and 
morning glory flower in light periods shorter than a certain threshold. Yet other 
species, like tomato for example, are day-neutral (ND) plant and flower 
independently from day length.  
Grafting experiments revealed that a mobile signal, florigen, is produced in 
the leaves of flowering plants in response to day length that moves through the 
plant towards the shoot apex to induce flowering. This mobile signal is able to 
move from a flowering stock across a graft junction into a vegetative shoot and 
induce flowering (Zeevaart, 1976)
Found CASE 2 (Pittendrigh, 1964)

Found CASE 2 (data not shown)
Found CASE 2 (HSP) from soybean (pHSP::FT and pHSP::GUS) showed that the 
activation of FT in a single leaf is sufficient to accelerate and maintain flowering 
(Notaguchi et al., 2008)
Found CASE 2 (data 
not shown). These data suggest that in contrast to Arabidopsis, a pulse of FT 
expression is not sufficient to induce flowering and that VEGGIE/FT has to be 
permanently expressed in petunia to maintain the cymose architecture. 
 
Is VEGGIE a mobile signal? 
VEGGIE is expressed in the phloem companion cells, but is essential in the apex 
to promote the transition to flowering and to specify the identity of newly formed 
sympodial meristems in the inflorescence. Several groups showed that in 
Arabidopsis the FT protein is transported from the leaves upwards to the shoot 
apex to promote flowering (Corbesier et al., 2007; Jaeger and Wigge, 2007; 
Kobayashi and Weigel, 2007; Mathieu et al., 2007; Notaguchi et al., 2008; 
Tamaki et al., 2007)
Found CASE 2 (data not shown). Hence, floral 
promoting signals coming from a flowering wild-type donor plant, but not from a 
veggie stock, were able to rescue the phenotype of a veggie graft, indicating that 
VEGGIE is a mobile signal. 
 
 
Discussion 
VEGGIE is necessary for the inflorescence meristem identity 
We show that VEGGIE encodes a protein of the PEBP family and is highly similar, 
and probably orthologous, to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and tomato 
SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT). Although VEGGIE and FT encode highly similar 
and functionally interchangeable proteins, they have partially distinct roles in the 
development of the racemose inflorescence of Arabidopsis and the cymose 
inflorescence of petunia. In Arabidopsis, FT is essential to make the switch from 
vegetative growth to flowering, but after the initial floral transition the apically 
placed IM continues growth in a indeterminate manner producing flowers in the 
lateral positions irrespective of the FT expression (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 1997)

Found CASE 2 (Solanaceae) 
tomato and petunia generate inflorescences of a distinct class that is named 
cyme. In cymes it is the apical meristem that forms the flower and growth 
continues from a lateral (also called sympodial) meristem that emerges at the 
periphery of the apical floral meristem (Castel et al., 2010)
Found CASE 2 (SIM) continues growth of the inflorescence by 
generating at its periphery the next SIM before it acquires floral identity and 
terminates by forming a flower.  
The differences between the spatio-temporal control of floral meristem 
identity in cymes and racemes are at least in part due to alterations in the 
expression patterns of the floral meristem identity genes, such as LFY and its 
petunia ortholog ABERRANT LEAF AND FLOWER (ALF), as well as UNUSUAL

Found CASE 2 (alterations in) the spatio-
temporal expression of genes that promote or inhibit the formation of flowers. 
Day length is in many species an important parameter by which plants monitor 
the progression of the seasons in order to commence flowering at a specific point 
in time. Early studies revealed that day length is perceived in the leaves to 
trigger the synthesis of a mobile compound, florigen, that travels to the apex of 
the shoot to promote the floral identity of newly formed meristem and the 
development of flowers.  
Genetic data indicate that the product of the FT gene of Arabidopsis is a 
major component of florigen or completely identical to it. The FT protein is 
synthesized in the leaf and travels to the apex where it interacts with a bZIP 
transcription factor encoded by the FD gene, to promote the expression of floral 
meristem identity genes (Abe et al., 2005; Wigge et al., 2005)

Found CASE 2 (see below). The
F-box protein is of interest, because LFY requires the
F-box UFO as a co-factor during flower patterning in
Arabidopsis (Levin and Meyerowitz 1995, Lee et al.
1997, Chae et al. 2008)
Found CASE 2 (tomato and petunia), LFY
activity generally depends on F-Box proteins during
additional stages and in additional pathways such as the
switch to flower formation (Lippman et al. 2008, Souer

Found CASE 2 (Cucumis sativus L.), cv. Mogami, a Japanese cul-
tivar, and cv. SpaceMaster, a cultivar in USA, were used as
indeterminate and determinate type cucumber, respectively.
Characteristics of cv. Mogami are a pickle type, tall stature,
monoecious flower, standard leaf size, late flowering, and
high yield. The genotype is De/De. Characteristics of cv.
SpaceMaster are a slice type, dwarfness, monoecious flower,
standard leaf size, early flowering, and high yield. The geno-
type of cv. SpaceMaster is de/de. In cv. SpaceMaster, apical
meristems are transformed to floral bud and flowering clus-
ters are formed when the plant reaches to the stage of ten true
leaves (Wehner 2005)

Found CASE 2 (e.g. cooling and SD treatments) and subsequent promotion (e.g.
heating and LD treatments) to SF cultivars are performed for early
and large fruit production. EB cultivars have been used to produce
fruits, particularly during summer, the changeover period for SF
cultivars.
In many plants, the time of floral initiation is governed by flo-
ral promoters and repressors that respond to environmental and
endogenous cues. A floral promoter that is produced under floral-
inductive photoperiods in the leaves, and functions in the shoot
apical meristem (SAM), is named a florigen (Chailakhyan, 1936)
Found CASE 2 (PEBP), such
as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis thaliana, and its ortho-
logues in several plant species, act as the systemic floral inducers,
also called ‘florigens’ (Lifschitz et al., 2006; Corbesier et al., 2007;
Lin et al., 2007; Tamaki et al., 2007)

he florigen concept, a floral inhibitor ‘antiflorigen’, which is pro-
uced in the leaves under non-floral-inductive photoperiods, was
lso proposed (Lang and Melchers, 1943)

Found CASE 2 (sepaline) operculum and the petal
primordia fuse to form an inner (petaline) operculum. The
entire umbel is enclosed by a pair of bracts which are shed
early in flower development as the bud elongates, followed by
the shedding of the sepaline operculum. The shedding of the
petaline operculum to expose the stamens and style occurs
once all parts of a flower are fully developed, from late
autumn to early summer in E. globulus (Jones et al. 2011)

Found CASE 2 (Gore and Potts 1995; Jones et al. 2011)
Found CASE 2 (i.e. two separate trees of the same genotype cloned by grafting)
each of an ‘Early’ (late autumn) and ‘Late’ (summer) anthesis
genotype from the Southern Tree Breeding Association breeding
population of E. globulus. The two ramets of each genotype were
named EarlyA, EarlyB, LateA and LateB. The ‘Early’ and ‘Late’
genotypes were from the Furneaux and Strzelecki Ranges
races, respectively, and were chosen for this study as these
races represent two of the extremes in time of anthesis. The
Furneaux and Strzelecki Ranges races are well differentiated on
many quantitative traits in addition to anthesis time (Dutkowski
and Potts 1999)

Found CASE 2 (shedding of the inner operculum to expose the stamens
and style) are still unknown. As anthesis time is a trait of
economic and ecological importance in E. globulus, the genes
that are potentially associated with this process are worth
pursuing. Anthesis occurs once all parts of the flower are fully
developed, and as the inner operculum is formed from fused
petals, the inner operculum abscission zone may be
developmentally equivalent to the petal abscission zone in
other species. Timing of abscission of flowers and flower parts
is controlled by the hormone ethylene in many plant species

Found CASE 2 (SAM) gives rise to
vegetative structures, eventually transitioning to the
reproductive stage that produces flowers. Because
photoperiod is measured in the leaf, signals must be
transmitted from the leaf to the shoot apex. This mobile
flowering signal, or florigen, has been proposed as the
messenger between photoreception in leaves and floral
initiation in the shoot apex.
In Arabidopsis, FT, which encodes phosphatidil
ethanol binding protein (PEBP), is expressed in leaf
phloem under LD conditions (Kardailsky et al. 1999;
Kobayashi et al. 1999; Yanovsky and Kay 2002)

Discussion
The implication of integrated genomics-assisted breed-
ing approach (combining QTL mapping/map-based clon-
ing with association mapping) for rapid identification of 
potential candidate genes/QTLs governing flowering time 
is well demonstrated in A. thaliana and legumes (Liu et al. 
2007; Pierre et al. 2008; Ehrenreich et al. 2009; Jung and 
Müller 2009; Brachi et al. 2010; Watanabe et al. 2011; Xia 
et al. 2012; Yeoh et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013)
Found CASE 2 (GWAS), a high-throughput GBS assay that is well-estab-
lished for simultaneous large-scale discovery and genotyp-
ing of SNPs at a genome-wide scale in chickpea (Deokar 
et al. 2014; Jaganathan et al. 2015; Kujur et al. 2015)
Found CASE 2 (Kujur et al. 2015)
Found CASE 2 (Weller et al. 2009; Kong 
et al. 2010; Laurie et al. 2011; Andres and Coupland 2012; 
Kim et al. 2012; Pin and Nilsson 2012; Watanabe et al. 
2012; Song et al. 2013; Yamashino et al. 2013; Zhai et al. 
2014; Weller and Martínez 2015)
Found CASE 2 (exhibiting preferential and flower-specific expression) 
during flower development in chickpea (Singh et al. 2013)
Found CASE 2 (2013)
Found CASE 2 (Jain 
et al. 2013; Varshney et al. 2013; Kujur et al. 2013, 2015; 
Saxena et al. 2014a)
Found CASE 2 (gene-associated targets) govern-
ing important agronomic traits, including flowering time 
in a larger chickpea genome with narrow genetic base. The 
CMLM model-based approach deployed in this study for 
GWAS usually considers all compression levels of popu-
lation structure, kinship and PCA algorithms for efficient 
estimation/detection of potential genomic loci associated 
with DF trait in chickpea. Therefore, this computation-
ally efficient model-based strategy had potential for rapid 
genome-wide scanning of non-spurious SNP marker-trait 
association with maximal statistical power and high predic-
tion accuracy (Lipka et al. 2012)
Found CASE 2 (Stanton-Geddes et al. 2013; Sax-
ena et al. 2014a, b; Kumar et al. 2015; Thudi et al. 2014)
Found CASE 2 (Kujur et al. 
2013, 2014; Saxena et al. 2014b; Bajaj et al. 2015a, b)
Found CASE 2 (validated by QTL map-
ping) flowering time-associated genes specifically in flower 
developmental stages of early flowering contrasting desi 
and kabuli accessions and mapping parents/homozygous 
mapping individuals based on differential gene expression 
profiling was apparent. The effective integration of expres-
sion profiling further with SNP marker-based gene haplo-
typing delineated diverse natural allelic variants and major 
haplotypes in eight known/candidate genes (including six 
genes harboring five robust QTLs) exhibiting strong asso-
ciation with early and late flowering time differentiation in 
chickpea.
The flowering time is a complex quantitative trait and 
being regulated through a complex genetic network involv-
ing diverse array of genes in crop plants (Andres and Cou-
pland 2012; Song et al. 2013)
Found CASE 2 (Flowering Locus T) genes (gene families) 
and their homologs are the key mobile flowering integra-
tors that stimulate/promote floral transition in the shoot 
apex of multiple plant species, including A. thaliana (Abe 
et al. 2005; Wigge et al. 2005; Ito et al. 2012; Kumar et al. 
2012; Liu et al. 2013; Nan et al. 2014)
Found CASE 2 (Cho et al. 2002; Lichtenzveig et al. 2006; Anbessa 
et al. 2006; Cobos et al. 2007, 2009; Radhika et al. 2007; 
Aryamanesh et al. 2010; Hossain et al. 2010; Gowda et al. 
2011; Rehman et al. 2011; Cho et al. 2012; Hiremath et al. 
2012; Vadez et al. 2012; Jamalabadi et al. 2013; Zhang 
et al. 2013; Varshney et al. 2014)
Found CASE 2 (GI) have been isolated and function-
ally characterized to ascertain their role in flowering time 
regulation in legumes and A. thaliana (Hecht et al. 2007; 
Liu et al. 2008; Weller et al. 2009; Kong et al. 2010; Laurie 
et al. 2011; Watanabe et al. 2009; 2011; 2012; Andres and

2012; Liu et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2014; Nan et al. 2014; 
Kawamoto et al. 2015)
Found CASE 2 (CRYPTOCHROME), which in turn activate the tran-
scription of key flowering regulator FT genes. A potential 
FLD (MtFD) gene governing flowering time has been iden-
tified by utilizing an integrated approach of whole genome 
sequence-based association genetics and QTL mapping 
in Medicago (Stanton-Geddes et al. 2013)
Found CASE 2 (Arabidopsis thaliana, Gly-
cine max, Medicago truncatula and Pisum sativum) towards 
flowering time trait regulation. More interestingly, bZIP 
transcription factor forming complex with protein encoded 
by FT gene is known to play a central role in activation of 
genes governing floral transition from vegetative to repro-
ductive development (Wang et al. 2009; Sussmilch et al. 
2015; Weller and Martínez 2015)
Found CASE 2 (Cardon et al. 1997; Guo et al. 2008; Yamaguchi et al. 
2009; Wang et al. 2009)
Found CASE 2 (Mo et al. 2007; Wang et al. 
2014)

gene in Arabidopsis and legumes (Hecht et al. 2007; Dubos 
et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2013; Yan et al. 
2014)
Found CASE 2 (identified by an integrated genomic approach) with vary-
ing potential for flowering time trait regulation and evolu-
tion. Therefore, the flowering time with regard to differ-
ential vernalization response in cultivated desi and kabuli 
and wild chickpea accessions (evolved due to domestica-
tion-led bottlenecks, Abbo et al. 2003; Berger et al. 2003, 
2005, Burger et al. 2008; Toker 2009; Meyer et al. 2012; 
Jain et al. 2013; Kujur et al. 2013; Varshney et al. 2013; 
Saxena et al. 2014a)
Found CASE 2 (mark-
ers, genes, QTLs, alleles and haplotypes) identified in our 
study with an integrated genomic approach can be useful 
for quantitative dissection of complex flowering time trait 
and eventually marker-assisted genetic enhancement to 
develop early flowering cultivars of chickpea.

Found CASE 2 (Boehmeria nivea L. Gaud), popularly known as “China grass,”
is a perennial short-day (SD) plant belonging to the family Urticaceae.
Ramie fibers extracted from the bast layer of the stem have a smooth
texture, long strands, and excellent tensile strength and are important
natural fibers. In China, ramie is the second most important fiber crop;
its growth acreage and quantity of fiber production are second only to
those of cotton. In addition, ramie has been used as a livestock forage
crop because of its high level of crude protein (Squibb et al., 1954)

Found CASE 2 (data not shown).  As one of the targets
of CO, FT functions as an integrator of the different
flowering regulatory pathways.  In order to know
whether it also plays a role on tuberization induction, in
this study StFT expression in the StCOL-antisense plants
was analysed.  StFT mRNA was not detected in the
stolons and tubers of these plants, while in its wild plants
there was expression with variable levels.  This result
reveals that StFT is in the downstream of StCOL and
might be involved in the StCOL-mediated regulation of
potato tuberization.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we reported a StFT gene cloned from
potato cultivar Désirée.  The gene was expressed in
leaves, apical buds, flowers, and swelling stolons of
the donor plants, but its transcript was not detected in
all organs examined of StCOL-antisense transgenic po-
tato plants, suggesting that StFT could be involved in
the regulation of potato tuberization as downstream of
StCOL gene, besides flowering induction.

Found CASE 2 (i) removal of methylation marks at promoter or adja-
cent sequences that hindered the binding of transcription fac-
tors at these sites; (ii) removal of cytosine methylation from
gene bodies such that transcription could now occur without
premature interruption; and (iii) read through from promoters
in transposons (especially retrotransposons located upstream
of the genes) activated because of their demethylation
(Henderson and Jacobsen 2007; Aceituno et al. 2008; He
et al. 2011)
Found CASE 2 (s)
at the sites of regulatory genes. The pleiotropies displayed
by the mutants are thought to result from gene expression
changes affecting various kinds of functions responsible for
achievement of plant morphology.
Mechanism of hypomethylation in lli, egd and ill mutants?
Inheritable demethylation at cytosine sites in the nuclear
DNA can occur via deficiency in the active DNA methylation
and maintenance DNA methylation pronounced demethy-
lation. Active methylation via RdDM is a process in
which a very large number of gene functions are involved
(Wierzbicki et al. 2012)

Found CASE 2 (Zhu 2009)
Found CASE 2 (permanently) altered to stress response. The
lli and egd mutations are perhaps illustrations of single site
mutation led morphologically distinctive and fertile changes
of evolutionary consequences. The lli, egd and ill mutants
of C. roseus may share some casual properties of altered
morphology with some well known epigenetic variants such
as of Linaria vulgaris (Cubas et al. 1999)

Found CASE 2 (Pharbitis nil, formerly 
Ipomoea nil) is a model ornamental plant. Libraries 
of expression sequence tags (ESTs) and bacterial 
artificial chromosomes have been created, genetic and 
molecular maps have subsequently been made available, 
transformation systems have been established, and whole 
genome sequencing is in progress. These experimental 
results are available through the National BioResource 
Project (NBRP) in Japan (Yamazaki et al. 2010)

QTL analysis has clear limitations that have been reviewed by several authors 
(Doerge and Rebai 1996; Beavis 1994; Kearsey and Farquhar 1998; Doerge 2002;

Found CASE 2 (expression QTLs, eQTLs) and, thereby, the study of the relationship between 
genome and transcriptome. These eQTLs can be utilized to search for associations 
between gene expression polymorphisms and a phenotypic QTL to identify candi-
date genes controlling phenotypic variation for an agronomic trait (Hansen et al. 
2008)
Found CASE 2 (metabolic pathway, development, defense response …) is converted into a 
common measure (z scaling or mean shifting) then, their QTL analysis will reveal 
network eQTLs; i.e. QTLs controlling gene expression networks or polymorphisms 
upstream in the process or pathway (Kliebenstein et al. 2006)

Found CASE 2 (eQTL analysis) is a promising application of 
transcriptome analysis. More recently, cDNA-AFLPs have been used as an alter-
native to microarrays to identify eQTLs in Arabidopsis (Vuylsteke et al. 2006)

been reported for some traits (in tomato, for instance, Lecomte et al. 2004; Causse 
et al. 2007; Estañ et al. 2008)

Found CASE 2 (overall pathogenesis-related genes and disease 
regulators). Obviously, this level of integration is only possible on model, fully 
sequenced, crops where the genetic map is anchored to a physical map, facilitating 
the assignment of genes, by function and position, to QTLs. After this, linkage 
disequilibrium studies are expected to facilitate validation and map-based cloning 
of genes (Gupta et al. 2005; Salvi and Tuberosa 2005)

Thus, finally, the huge scientific advances due to QTL mapping and “omics” 
resources, after validation are expected to be translated into heritable assays that are 
more effective and efficient than phenotypic assays to enhance germplasm and 
plant breeding (Beavis et al. 2007)

(Kearsy et al. 2003)
Found CASE 2 (G × E) that limits our understanding of agronomic traits. In this 
sense, the use of marker-assisted selection (MAS) can be inefficient if the effects 
of G × E and epistasis cannot be anticipated (Openshaw and Frascaroli 1997; Moreau 
et al. 2004)

Found CASE 2 (salinity, for instance). If it happens in one or more QTLs 
for the same environment, it will cause just a scaling effect but it will not alter the 
ranking of genotypes. But, if the variance heterogeneity affects different QTLs 
depending on the environments, a re-ranking of genotypes will happen which is a 
major concern to breeders, particularly those devoted to increase crop adaptability 
to abiotic stresses.
To determine genetic factors responsible for G × E, agronomic data must be 
collected on a mapping population in multiple environment trials. Then, compari-
son of QTL detection across environments is carried out by analysis of variance to 
test marker locus × environment interactions (Sari-Gorla et al. 1997; Villalta et al. 
2007)

Markers tightly linked to loci controlling difficult, laborious and expensive but 
breeding-targeted traits are valuable tools to assist selection at seedling stage dur-
ing the breeding program of a long-lasting juvenility crop or forest species. Thus, 
MAS have been most frequently used (or reported) to discard putative disease 
susceptible plants in the early generations and to introgress disease resistance 
genes into high-quality well adapted elite cultivars. The greatest efficiency of 
MAS is in early generations due to the increasing probability of recombination 
between the marker and QTL; the major disadvantage is the cost of genotyping a 
large number of plants given that it is applied at the beginning of the program 
(Collard and Mackill 2008)

Found CASE 2 (version of the D genome present in the 
allotetraploid) remains largely unchanged from that of its diploid progenitor, while 
two reciprocal translocations along with several inversions distinguish A from At 
chromosomes. While the diploid D-genome species does not produce spinnable 
fiber, it imparts important genes or regulators involved in fiber morphogenesis and 
its properties (Jiang et al. 1998; Paterson et al. 2003; Ulloa et al. 2005; Rong et al.

Found CASE 2 (NPA), 
which has some of the same disadvantages as RNA gel blot hybridization. However, 
with NPA there is a possibility of studying multiple RNA targets, provided the 
lengths of the hybridizing probes are distinctly different. Nonetheless the sensitivity, 
low throughput nature and non-quantitative or at best semi-quantitative nature of 
these two methods preclude the requirements for present gene expression analyses 
aimed at interactions among genes. Although in situ hybridization methods have in 
recent years become more sensitive, their successful establishment is still deter-
mined by user experience, extensive optimization, labor-intensiveness and probably 
irreproducibility among laboratories. Moreover, due to the feverish pace with 
which the repertoire of genome sequence data is accumulating, the need for more 
sensitive and high throughput expression analysis methods became imperative.

Saiki et al. 1988)
Found CASE 2 (Veres et al. 1987)
Found CASE 2 (reverse-transcriptase PCR) 
approach has had significant influence on gene expression analysis. However, 
sensitivity and quantification were still debatable. Further refinement of quantification 
aspects during PCR amplification led to the development of the kinetic or real-time 
PCR with monitoring of amplification at each cycle and the possibility of relating 
the amplified products to the starting amount of template (Higuchi et al. 1993)
Found CASE 2 (QPCR) for 
assessing accumulation of transcripts became another important tool for gene 
expression studies in the last decade and offered multiplexing capabilities of four to 
five genes simultaneously. Notwithstanding the sensitivity and relative accuracy of 
the QPCR, the limited number of genes which could be studied at a single time 
prevented global snap-shots of several genes simultaneously. To understand the up- and 
down-regulation of genes in a holistic perspective there was a requirement for 
looking at the expression of as many genes as possible; the so-called gene expression 
or transcriptome profiling approach. In addition to being generally sensitive, the 
developed methods for expression profiling were also high-throughput.
Currently there are three main large-scale high-throughput expression profiling 
techniques based on PCR, hybridization or DNA-sequencing. Hybridization strategy-
reliant approaches include cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays (Schena et al. 
1995; Lockhart et al. 1996)

Found CASE 2 (QTL) association with complex traits and the possi-
bility of identifying and cloning candidate genes by map-based cloning. Microarray 
studies recognize up- and down-regulated genes among individuals under different 
conditions and/or plant developmental stages. It became evident that this expres-
sion profiling approach was a powerful tool to comprehensively understand the 
global patterns of gene expression. To further improve on this perception, a new 
concept of “genetical genomics” was put forward to relate genetic variation due to 
QTL in a segregating population to genome-wide expression profiling data, and 
therefore identify the proportion of the variation in gene expression actually associ-
ated with such QTL (Jansen and Nap 2001)
Found CASE 2 (Schadt et al. 2003)
Found CASE 2 (eQTL) was able to account for 
the transcription variation of the genes associated with a trait.
Besides the advantage of eQTL in relating expression data as a quantitative trait for 
association with phenotypes, it was also suggested that the proportion of expression 
variation that actually maps to the genes themselves would qualify as cis-acting 
factors and those mapping to other regions as trans-acting factors (Jansen and Nap 
2001)

Found CASE 2 (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/grain-
genes/sql.cgi) provides SQL access to its database. Web services provide a pro-
grammatic interface to databases and web-based tools and are increasingly being 
used to automate execution of the data retrieval and analysis steps. The users can 
look up XML-based web service registries that list name, products, locations and 
services offered by the web service provider on the Internet. Examples of popular 
bioinformatics web services projects include BioMoby (The BioMoby Consortium 
2008)
Found CASE 2 (www.mygrid.org.uk). The web service registry here is differ-
ent from traditional web services in that it uses the meaning of terms in the bio-
logical vocabulary (semantics) to mediate web service discovery and invocation. 
This helps overcome the problem inherent to biological data – that of inconsistent 
data type. The Virtual Plant Information network hosted at the NCGR is another 
network of data and service providers based on the semantic web services plat-
form (http://vpin.ncgr.org/). This network differs from paradigmatic web services 
in that it does not use SOAP for information exchange but instead relies on http 
and the web ontology language (OWL-DL), a web standard for information pro-
cessing. VPIN has a web front end that allows users to find disparate data and 
services based on lexical and semantic criteria. The DAS (Distributed Annotation 
System) is another data retrieval protocol that can be used for the exchange of 
biological sequence annotation. It allows a single machine to gather up sequence 
annotation information from multiple distant web sites, collate the information, 
and display it to the user in a single view (Prlic et al. 2007)
Found CASE 2 (Critchlow et al. 2000)

Found CASE 2 (GO), a community 
effort to provide controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attri-
butes in any organism. When one database describes a piece of data as being “a 
gene as defined by the Gene Ontology”, the data consumer can use or not use 
the data based on the understanding of “a gene as defined by the Gene 
Ontology” rather than worry about datasource specific definitions of the ‘gene’. 
Similarly, the Plant Ontology Consortium (POC) (www.plantontology.org) is a 
collaborative effort to develop simple yet robust and extensible controlled 
vocabularies that accurately reflect the biology of plant structures and develop-
mental stages. There is Trait Ontology (TO) for traits and phenotype data (http://
www.gramene.org/plant_ontology/trait.ontology). MyGrid and BioMoby ontolo-
gies are for the semantic discovery of bioinformatics services. They use onto-
logical reasoning over both data type and service definitions for service 
discovery. Clients can interact with multiple sources of biological data, regard-
less of the underlying database format/schema. While ontologies are being 
implemented only by a small number of data sources, they become relevant to 
the interoperability of expanding database collections (http://www.gramene.org/
resources/plant_databases.pdf). There are published examples to show the application of 
semantic web technologies to build data warehouses that facilitate integration 
of genomic/proteomic data (Smith et al. 2007)

Found CASE 2 (MSA) is an alignment of three or more protein, 
DNA or RNA sequences and the purpose of creating such an alignment is to high-
light their similarity or differences, which might reflect the biological relationship 
between them. Generation of MSA is a very useful exercise and needs special care 
when being used in phylogenetic tree construction, for identification of profiles 
and structure prediction, or in degenerate primer design. Computing exact MSAs is 
computationally almost impossible, and in practice approximate algorithms 
(heuristics) are used to align multiple sequences, by maximizing their similarity. 
Many MSA algorithms are in use, including the popular matrix-based methods

Functional annotation is the process of collecting information about and describ-
ing a gene’s biological identity – its various aliases, molecular function, biological 
role(s), subcellular location and its expression domains within the plant. The asso-
ciation between sequence and functional phenotype can be predicted using homol-
ogy search tools based on sequence alignment. Larger data sources like TAIR 
(The Arabidopsis Information Resource) use a combination of published literature, 
solicited contributions from the research community as well as computational 
analyses of the sequence as part of the functional annotation process (Swarbreck 
et al. 2007)
Found CASE 2 (Beisvag et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (http://seq.cs.iastate.edu/) and TGICL(http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/

tion have versions suitable for crops such as maize and Arabidopsis. The 
NetPlantGene web server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPGene/) provides 
tools for the prediction of splice sites in Arabidopsis besides modelling and struc-
ture prediction tools. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated 
Discovery (DAVID, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) provides a comprehensive set 
of functional annotation tools. AutoFACT is another fully automated and cus-
tomizable annotation tool that assigns biologically informative functions to a 
sequence (Koski et al. 2005)

Found CASE 2 (Gupta 
et al. 2002)
Found CASE 2 (SNP), diversity array technology (DArTs) and single feature 
polymorphism (SFP). Indeed, till recent past, molecular markers from the first two 
categories have been developed in majority of the crop species, which belonged to 
genomic DNA, and therefore could belong to either the transcribed or the non-tran-
scribed part of the genome without any information available on their functions. 
Nevertheless, during last few years, it has been possible to develop the markers from 
transcribed region of the genome or genes. Such markers have been popularly referred 
as functional markers/FMs (Anderson and Lübberstedt 2003; Gupta and Rustgi 2004)
Found CASE 2 (Varshney et al. 2007c)
Found CASE 2 (West et al. 2006b)
Found CASE 2 (see Varshney 
et al. 2009)
Found CASE 2 (see the companion 
chapter in this volume by Jayashree and Hoisington). Because of these two main 
factors, the era of development of gene-based markers has taken off in plant sys-
tems and is in advanced stage at present (Gupta and Rustgi 2004; Varshney et al. 
2005a, 2007c, 2007d)
Found CASE 2 (polymorphic or non-polymorphic site in the gene), genic 
markers have been classified into two groups (Anderson and Lübberstedt 2003)
Found CASE 2 (a) 
gene targeted markers (GTMs), that are derived from polymorphisms within genes, 
however not necessarily involved in phenotypic trait variation, e.g. EST-based molec-
ular markers (Schmitt et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (b) functional markers (FMs) are derived from 
polymorphic sites within genes causally involved in phenotypic trait variation, e.g. 
candidate gene-based molecular markers. Depending on the involvement in the phe-
notypic trait variation, the FMs can be classified further into two subgroups: (a) direct 
functional markers (DFMs), for which the role for the phenotypic trait variation is 
well proven, and (b) indirect functional markers (IFMs), for which the role for phe-
notypic trait variation is indirectly known (Anderson and Lübberstedt 2003)
Found CASE 2 (e.g. 
Gupta and Rustgi 2004; Varshney et al. 2005a, 2007c)
Found CASE 2 (e.g. 
Arabidopsis, Medicago, Lotus, Poplar) and major crop species (rice, wheat, maize, 
sorghum, soybean, grape). In such plant species, based on functional annotation, gene 
expression and physiological studies, candidate genes can be identified for marker 
development. However in several crop species e.g. rye, sweet potato, pigeonpea and 
millets that have less genomic resources, identification of candidate genes is not 
easily feasible. However, because of the availability of next generation sequencing 
technologies, it has been shown very recently that the genic markers can be developed 
in so-called orphan crop species also (Varshney et al. 2009)
Found CASE 2 (and different parts of gene) suggested higher frequency of SNP in 
intronic regions of the gene (Ching et al. 2002; Rajesh and Muehlbauer 2008)
Found CASE 2 (Bertin et al. 2005)
Found CASE 2 (Feltus et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (DR Cook, personal 
communication) to develop gene-based conserved orthologous sequence (COS) 
markers in legume species. These primer pairs have been used to amplify the intronic 
regions in the parental genotypes of mapping populations of seven legume species 
including chickpea, common bean, groundnut, cowpea and pigeonpea which are 
being sequenced at present to identify the SNPs between parental genotypes of the 
mapping populations of these species. This study is expected to develop the extended 
version of comparative legume genetic maps developed earlier by Choi et al. (2004)
Found CASE 2 (CISPs) have been developed for monocot species (Feltus et al. 
2006; Lohithaswa et al. 2007; http://www.plantgenome.uga.edu/CISP/). Following 
the similar approach, a larger number of gene-based markers have been developed 
and used for diversity and mapping studies in pearl millet (Bertin et al. 2005)
Found CASE 2 (Phan et al. 2007)
Found CASE 2 (http://
www.icrisat.org/gt-bt/CISPTool.htm) for the identification of conserved intron scan-
ning regions using EST alignments to a completely sequenced model crop genome 
and designing conserved intron scanning primers will greatly facilitate development 
of CISPs in several orphan crop species (Jayashree et al. 2008)
Found CASE 2 (Sreenivasulu et al. 
2004; Krist and Yu 2007)
Found CASE 2 (Affymetrix) to reveal genetic polymor-
phisms, if the transcript profiling has been done on different genotypes of the 
species. This polymorphism, also called expression level polymorphism (ELP), 
has been used as marker to genotype individuals in mapping populations (West 
et al. 2006a, 2006b)
Found CASE 2 (Winzeler 
et al. 1998)
Found CASE 2 (or overlapping fea-
tures), this would also result in differential hybridizations, however confined to 
that feature alone. Such polymorphism observed has been termed as single 
feature polymorphism (SFP) (Borevitz et al. 2003)
Found CASE 2 (Brem 
et al. 2002; Borevitz et al. 2003; Bing and Hoeschele 2005; Bystrykh et al.

Found CASE 2 (derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences) assay can be developed by 
creating a mismatch in a PCR primer to create a polymorphism based on the target 
mutation (Neff et al. 1998, 2002)
Found CASE 2 (SSCP)
In general polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis doesn’t allow detection of polymor-
phism due to difference of one base pair length/type. Single stranded DNA confir-
mation polymorphism (SSCP) methodology, however, allows detection of 
polymorphism due to differences of one or more base pairs in the PCR products 
that is suitable for SNP genotyping. The methodology relies on the secondary struc-
ture being different for single strands derived from PCR products that differ by one 
or more nucleotides at an internal site. For assays using SSCP methodology, PCR 
products of different genotypes carrying the SNP site are denatured and electropho-
retically separated in neutral acrylamide gel. Because of occurrence of SNPs in 
different genotypes, the gel will show the difference in the length of the resolving 
fragments. This methodology has been used in several species like Picea (Germano 
and Klein 1999)

Found CASE 2 (FMs) can be used for all the applications where 
traditional markers have been or can be used. In addition, the use of FMs provide 
added value for a particular application aimed at crop improvement. For instance, 
on one hand the FMs have been proven the “perfect markers” for foreground selection 
in marker-assisted selection (MAS), the availability of (or possibility to develop) 
low cost and high throughput genotyping platforms for gene-based markers (e.g. 
GoldenGate assays/Illumina arrays) for many crops make these markers the most 
suitable markers for background selection in marker-assisted breeding (MAB). 
When these markers are used in the genetic diversity studies, they assay the func-
tional genetic variation in the germplasm collection and therefore can be used for 
allele mining and association genetics studies. Due to their origin from conserved 
proportion of the genome, gene-based markers of a species can be used in related 
species for a variety of applications including enhancing the density of genetic 
maps (Varshney et al. 2007a)

Found CASE 2 (IARCs) and national genebanks in different countries. In order to utilize the ger-
mplasm of genebank in breeding programme in the efficient way, the manageable 
collection of germplasm called “core collection”, “mini-core collection”, “reference 
collection” etc. have been developed in several crop species (e.g., Varshney et al. 
2007c)
Found CASE 2 (s) for the FM in these germplasm 
collections provides a range of alleles for the given FM/gene. Phenotyping of the 
germplasm collection for the respective trait and their analysis with allele data 
should provide the better alleles for the respective trait (Slade and Knauf 2005)
Found CASE 2 (Ersoz et al. 2007)
Found CASE 2 (Rostoks et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (s) using the germplasm collection held in genebanks or mutant 
populations. Availability of high-throughput genome-wide and low cost genotyping 
platform provides opportunities to accelerate breeding practices through the use of 
markers in background selection during marker-assisted breeding.
Recent advances in nanotechnology, nucleic acid chemistry, computational biology 
and automation indicates that development and application of gene-based markers 
using high-throughput marker discovery and genotyping assay is still a relatively 
young field, and more exciting advances are expected in the future. One of the great 
promises of genic markers, using high-throughput approaches, is that the ability to 
carry out comprehensive genomic analyses easily, inexpensively, accurately and 
rapidly with high sensitivity should create a new generation of routine genomic 
tools to assist the crop breeding.

Found CASE 2 (MAB) is an effective aid to selection in 
backcrossing: first as the target trait can be directly monitored, hence avoiding phe-
notypic scoring. Then, as markers closely linked to the target gene can limit the 
surrounding DNA from the donor parent, thus removing possible linkage drag. 
Finally, as markers dispersed over the genome permit the selection of progeny with 
higher proportions of the recurrent parent genetic background (Holland 2004)

Alleles not expressed in the selection environment. –
Combining traits that might mask each other’s effects (e.g. pyramiding  –
resistance genes).
The technology is indispensable for GM-quality control of commercial cultivars. –
This kind of applications usually implies a limited amount of molecular markers 
used to screen large number of samples.
Whole genome study, or fingerprinting, enables the characterization of genotypes 
and the estimation of genetic relatedness between lines. This information is crucial 
to allow plant breeders to appropriately choose the parental lines for their crosses 
especially for hybrid production (Ma et al. 2003)

Found CASE 2 (SSRs) are especially interesting as they are well spread

thus liberating the highly qualified staff to perform more complex and demanding 
applications. The fully-automated system developed at SW, like any automated 
molecular screening settings, provides the ability to efficiently generate large dataset 
from either a large amount of material and/or markers. This system is flexible 
enough to adapt to the requirements of practical breeding in regards to molecular 
analyses i.e. to assay realistically high numbers of samples as promptly and as 
cheaply as possible and thus enabling practical “molecular breeding”.
It is important to keep in mind that automation of “molecular breeding” is an 
ongoing process, not only in terms of technical development but rather as a constant 
questioning of the different breeding-specific applications, trying to fulfil the main 
goal of breeders: to promptly release the best product quality at the lowest cost. The 
increasing amount of sequence information and the determination of gene function 
are leading to the use of emerging marker types such as SNPs. They hold great promises 
of rapid and highly automated genotyping (Gupta et al. 1999; Korzun 2003)

Found CASE 2 (s). Large amount of chemical pesticides and fungicides are 
being used which lead to increase in cost of production and in addition it causes 
environmental pollution.
A key step in breeding better crops that survive under stress has been to understand 
the changes in cellular, biochemical and molecular processes that occur in response to 
stress. Modern molecular techniques involve the identification and use of molecular 
markers that can accelerate the efficiency of breeding programs. However, the 
introgression of genomic portions (QTLs) involved in stress tolerance often carry 
undesirable agronomic characteristics from the donor parents. This is because of 
the lack of a precise knowledge of the key genes underlying the QTLs controlling the 
target traits. In this context, development of genetically engineered plants by the intro-
duction and/or over-expression of selected genes seem to be a viable option to hasten 
the breeding of “improved” plants or in generating the precious pre-breeding materials. 
Intuitively, genetic engineering would be a faster way to introduce any target ben-
eficial genes than through conventional or molecular breeding. Also, it would be 
the only option when genes of interest originate from cross barrier species, distant rela-
tives, or from non-plant sources. Following these logical steps, various transgenic 
technologies have been used to improve stress tolerance in plants (Allen 1995)

Found CASE 2 (i) a combination

engineering strategy involving a well balanced expression of transgenes with 
different modes of action would ensure enhanced and durable resistance against 
different pathogens at a time. Availability of genes associated with disease resis-

Found CASE 2 (RFLPs), and which were later followed by based on the polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR), a faster and less expensive technology. PCR-based DNA markers include 
random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), amplified fragment length poly-
morphisms (AFLPs), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS), and 
sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs), which have been extensively 
used in different applications.
Even today, RFLPs offer the best marker type for many purposes. The main 
drawbacks of using RFLPs are the high cost and the low throughput of genotyping. 
RAPDs and AFLPs have also been widely used in genetic diversity studies and 
gene mapping. Both technologies are particularly useful when there is a need to 
assay loci across the entire genome. Nevertheless, their dominant nature, the lack 
of reproducibility of RAPDs compared with AFLPs and the lack of specificity in 
both cases, are limiting factors for their application in accurate MAS breeding 
approaches. However, random techniques such as RAPDs and AFLPs are highly 
useful for finding new markers linked to desirable alleles. Once such markers are 
identified, the corresponding bands can be sequenced and used to develop more 
specific and reliable markers such as CAPs or SCARs that simplify the screening 
of large progenies (Edwards and McCouch 2007)

has also led to the development of a new generation of markers, gene-targeted

Found CASE 2 (and their compo-
nents) by dissecting them into underlying Mendelian units, the so-called QTLs 
(Lebreton et al. 1995; Prioul et al. 1997; Quarrie et al. 1999)
Found CASE 2 (or yield stability) in the mapping population, it is possible to test much more 
precisely than before whether a particular yield (Ribaut et al. 1997; Yadav et al. 2002, 
2004)
Found CASE 2 (ABA) has been shown to be 
involved in regulating stomatal conductance, osmotic adjustment and root con-
ductivity, interests have been shown in measuring ABA contents in order to estab-
lish relationships with drought resistance (Austin et al. 1982; Dingkuhn et al. 
1991; Sanguineti et al. 1999)
Found CASE 2 (L-ABA) also harboured QTLs for stomatal conductance, 
drought sensitivity index, leaf temperature, leaf relative water content, anthesis 
silking interval, and grain yield. The analysis of effects of each QTL region on 
the investigated traits indicated that L-ABA represented an indicator of level of 
drought stress experienced by the plant at the time of sampling because an 
increase in L-ABA was most commonly associated with a decrease in grain yield 
(Sanguineti et al. 1999)

Found CASE 2 (QTLs influencing the level of expression of a particular gene). In this case, 
the analysis of the level of gene expression performed on each progeny of a 
mapping population will identify eQTLs influencing the observed variability among 
progenies in mRNA level of the profiled genes. Circumstantial evidence regarding 
the importance of each open reading frame (ORF) in governing variability for yield 
under conditions of drought can be obtained by comparing the map position of 
QTLs for yield with the map position of the ORFs itself and the corresponding 
eQTLs (Tuberosa et al. 2007)
Found CASE 2 (FMs) designed from within the 
genes. FMs are superior to random markers such as RFLPs, SSRs and AFLPs 
owing to complete linkage with trait locus alleles and functional motifs (Andersen 
and Lübberstedt 2003)
Found CASE 2 (defined by one or several FM alleles) in several genetic backgrounds. This would 
be a major advance in marker applications, particularly in plant breeding, to select 
for example parent materials to build segregating populations, as well as for 
subsequent selections while constructing a variety (Andersen and Lübberstedt 
2003)

that have been more extensively investigated in species whose genome has been

QTL-NILs, which isogenizes the QTL region, transformed the task of QTL cloning 
into one gene, similar to that performed for Mendelian traits. The major drawback

for identifying NILs has been validated in rice (Prabuddha et al. 2008)

Found CASE 2 (such as wheat and maize) 
by using co-linear regions from a smaller genome species (such as rice and sorghum). 
Through comparative mapping and bioinformatics it will hopefully be possible to 
utilize the vast knowledge emerging in model systems for the direct benefit of the 
closely related, lesser-studied ‘orphan’ crops. Extensive comparative genomics studies 
have already been completed amongst cereal species and much of this information 
is presented at the GRAMENE (http://www.gramene.org/) portal. Despite large 
difference in DNA content and chromosome number, the grass genomes maintain a 
high level of conserved macro-synteny and a moderate to high level of micro-synteny 
(Gale and Devos 1998)

Found CASE 2 (i.e., accurate description of accessions and application of effective 
procedures) and its evaluation for useful agronomic traits. The availability of a 
robust genetic characterization ensures that decisions made on conservation strategies 
will be supported by this information and results in an improved germplasm 
management. Of the experimental activities associated to plant genetic resources, 
the morpho-phenological and molecular evaluation of germplasm adds value to 
plant genetic resources and it is particularly important because helps the identifica-
tion of genes and traits, and thus provides the basic knowledge for the exploitation 
of collections in programs aimed at breeding new crop varieties.
Classical attempts to directly use plant accessions stored in germplasm banks in 
breeding programs have been mainly focused to the identification of sources of 
genes of interest, such as resistance to plant pathogens or pests, and their transfer 
to cultivated materials. Linkage drag has very often restrained breeders from the 
initiative of using accessions from germplasm banks mainly because the improved 
material of advanced breeding programs is far more attractive than any germplasm 
resource of unknown genetic origin and phenotypic adaptation or performance

maternal and paternal origin in experimental populations. Moreover, wide-genome 
scanning approaches provide a method for rapidly identifying molecular markers 
linked to a specific genetic trait and accurately locating genes in a saturated genetic 
map. For instance, the identification of AFLP markers associated with specific genes 
based on the use of markers randomly distributed in the genome coupled with the use 
of near isogenic lines (NIL) or bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was applied not only 
in diploids but also in remarkably complex auto- and allo-polyploids. Both strategies 
are based on pooling the DNAs from individuals sharing the same genetic background 
but showing extreme classes of a given trait, and then screening for differences 
between genetic classes using molecular markers. Molecular differential screening of 
plants with contrasting characteristics is still considered one of the most powerful 
tools for identifying, isolating and using the genes underlying the expression of 
Mendelian traits and QTLs (quantitative trait loci). Similarly, natural populations can 
be exploited for discovering molecular markers linked to agronomically important 
genes by means of association mapping through linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis. 
Interest in the study of LD, i.e. non-random association of alleles, in crop plants has 
increased dramatically in recent years because of two main factors (reviewed by

Found CASE 2 (GS) estimates between populations are also very often 
computed using dominant molecular markers. These estimates are traditionally 
calculated in all possible pair-wise comparisons between individuals either within 
or between populations using different genetic similarity parameters. For instance, 
genetic similarity estimates between individuals can be calculated using the 
following formula of Dice (1945)

The importance of the variation captured in genetic resources in allowing 
evolution and/or facilitating plant breeding has been long recognized. However, 
appreciating the variation held in collections is not sufficient. Conservation of genetic 
resources needs to be combined with an enhanced use of conserved materials. 
Worldwide germplasm collections of crop plant species maintained ex situ in gene 
banks together with that held in situ and on farm situations harbour abundant quan-
tities of hidden allelic variants. The challenge is to unravel the mysteries of this 
variation so that it can be used for the benefit of humankind. More and more, 
technologies have increased throughputs, which generally means the generation of 
progressively larger amounts of genetic data. Genotyping individuals to identify the 
available allelic variation that makes up the phenotypes provide the groundwork on 
which genetic resources can be used in plant breeding. Phenotyping is very much 
linked to the usefulness of good molecular characterization, together forming the basis 
of progress in modern genomics research in crop plants (De Vicente et al. 2006)

Besides quality control and hybridization reproducibility issues, microarray data 
analysis and interpretation are challenging because of the sheer quantity of data to 
be handled and the large numbers of genes showing differential expression. 
Moreover, some genes showing large expression differences could have minimal 
impact while others with minimal expression differences could have profound 
effects. Genes showing marginal differential expression are easily overlooked in 
microarray analyses. Microarray expression data should be validated by other 
means such as quantitative RT-PCR or Northern blot hybridization.
Some of the inherent limitations of expression profiling by ESTs (such as high 
cost, high labour and inability to perform tissue specific expression quantification) 
and microarray (such as background signal intensities rivalling those of weakly 
expressed mRNAs, inability to distinguish closely related transcripts or transcript 
variants and incomplete genome coverage) can be overcome by tag-based tech-
nologies such as SAGE and MPSS (see Kikuchi et al. 2007)

Transcribed sequences remain attractive DNA markers because assumptions on 
gene function can be associated with specific traits of interest. An alternative 
marker generated from ESTs includes single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). 
However, SNP analysis in hexaploid wheat is more challenging than comparable 
studies in diploids, requiring the development of genome-specific SNP markers to 
ensure one of the genomes is amplified to reveal haplotypes in the specific genome 
being studied. Several studies used EST contig assembly to identify SNPs (Mochida

Found CASE 2 (RNAi) is a sequence-specific gene silencing mechanism whereby small interfer-
ing RNAs (siRNA) bind to target mRNA triggering the synthesis of double 
stranded RNA (dsRNA). The dsRNA are targets for cleaving by Dicer enzyme into 
subsequent siRNA molecules causing post-transcriptional gene silencing by 
mRNA degradation and methylation of homologous DNA (Meyer and Saedler 
1996; Tijsterman et al. 2002; Denli and Hannon 2003; Baulcombe 2004; Meins

alternative markers as they are made available for numerous other traits associated 
with drought tolerance, extreme temperatures and other phenotypes (biotic and 
other abitoic stress) important for regional adaptation. The future application of 
genomics to identify new FAM for numerous traits will become more important to 
assist breeding high yielding wheat varieties adaptable to changing environments.

Found CASE 2 (Targeting

uses traditional mutagenesis followed by high-throughput mutation discovery to 
identify deleterious lesions in specific target genes. The technique has proven to be 
robust and easily applied to a variety of different species including Arabidopsis,

Found CASE 2 (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), fewer such lesions will be tolerated in a 
genome. If a mutagenic treatment induces a mixture of large and small lesions, the 
result would be a lower maximal density of lesions than, for example, what could 
be obtained with a mutagen causing only SNPs. Studies of gamma and carbon 
irradiation of Arabidopsis pollen showed that small and large deletions and inver-
sions can occur due to mutagenic treatment (Naito et al. 2005)

Rapid advancements in next generation sequencing platforms hold great promise 
for increasing the efficiency of mutation discovery for TILLING. Next-generation 
sequencing can be defined as any number of new technologies that promise to 
dramatically increase the speed and reduce the cost of DNA sequencing when 
compared to traditional Sanger sequencing. Technologies include currently 
commercial pyrosequencing and mass spectroscopy based platforms to the devel-
oping field of nanopore sequencing (Hall 2007; Shendure et al. 2008)

Found CASE 2 (homeologue) per TILLING assay using enzymatic mismatch cleavage for

to the failure to detect mutations (Cooper et al. 2008)

For vegetatively propagated crops, the challenges of developing a suitable 
TILLING population mainly lie in the choice of mutagen, tissue to be mutagenized 
and the ability to either obtain a sufficient density of dominant mutations, or to cre-
ate double haploid plants. Work with vegetatively propagated crops is just begin-
ning and the information regarding efficient approaches will have to be gathered 
through trial and error. Where resources for in vitro techniques are limited, small 
TILLING populations can be generated and then rapidly screened, and only plant-
lets with interesting mutations maintained for further analysis. This live population 
strategy has been previously used for Drosophila and Zebrafish (Bentley et al.

will enable the identification of large numbers of the small RNAs involved in the 
abiotic stress responses. Comparative genomics studies using bioinformatic 
approaches will also lead to our better understanding of the function and biological 
significance of the non-coding RNAs such as small RNAs.
Recently, metabolome analysis has become a useful approach to study meta-
bolic changes in response to stress (Cook et al. 2004; Rizhsky et al. 2004; 
Urano et al. unpublished results). Metabolome profiling experiments enable us 
to identify a large number of metabolites that increased or decreased during the 
stress conditions. Integration of metabolome data with the transcriptome data 
during the stress condition should help us identify the key metabolic pathway 
genes for genetic engineering of the stress tolerance and find novel pathways in 
the stress response.

The somewhat spontaneous rainfall and water availability patterns experienced by 
most plants on earth have resulted in the evolution of adaptive responses to 
maintain life during times of water deficit. When water becomes scarce plants may 
adapt to maintain sufficient tissue hydration and/or to maintain function whilst 
dehydrated (Taiz and Zeiger 2002)

gies to avoid damage caused by ROS. Plant enzymatic defences include antioxidant 
enzymes such as the phenol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxi-
dase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase which, together with other enzymes of the 
ascorbate-glutathione cycle, promote the scavenging of ROS (Hernandez et al. 2001;

Found CASE 2 (DNA) and biochemical 
markers closely linked to quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting salt tolerance 
are good candidates because their expression are almost independent from the 
environment, and powerful biometric methods have been developed and applied 
to QTL mapping.
The main goal of QTL detection is marker-assisted selection (MAS) and QTL 
cloning (Asins 2002)
Found CASE 2 (2002)
Found CASE 2 (RIL) or double 
haploids (DH) can be reproduced independently and continuously evaluated with 
respect to additional quantitative traits and markers, with all the information being 
cumulative. Additive and epistatic interaction can be determined with RIL and DH 
but not dominant or over-dominance effects.
When dealing with a complex character as tolerance to salinity that depends 
on a number of quantitative traits, QTL analysis allows an integrative approach. 
Total phenotypic variation can be explained in three main ways: the identifica-
tion of QTLs partially controlling the tolerance by analysing multiple traits in 
the same segregating population; the contribution of QTL × Environment (E) 
interaction; and the contribution of QTL × QTL interactions or epistastatic 
effects. Such analyses under different salinity levels and plant stage(s) can only 
be properly and efficiently carried out using populations of DHs or RILs 
(Cuartero et al. 2006)

Found CASE 2 (RIL or DH) are grown in at least two 
salinity conditions (control and saline), more QTL have been identified in saline 
than in control conditions, and significant QTL × E interaction has been found in

Found CASE 2 (e.g. genes involved in ionic homeostasis) and can be 
useful for the pre-selection of transgenic lines (if an in vitro and in vivo correlation 
has previously been shown), but they should not be used as the only criterion to 
determine the degree of salt tolerance. In evaluating the tolerance of transgenic 
crops, it is important to perform long-term experiments, focus on growth and yield, 
and provide quantitative data (Flowers 2004; Munns and Tester 2008)

Found CASE 2 (e.g. osmotic adjustment, osmopro-
tection, ionic homeostasis, oxygen free radical scavengeing, stress response, 
restoration of enzymatic activity, photorespiration; Bohnert et al. 1996)
Found CASE 2 (e.g. one that codes for a transcription factor) can have a 
cascade effect, modifying the expression of many genes. Alternatively, the 
expression of a gene involved in the compartmentalisation of ions in the vacuoles 
may alleviate toxic effects. Even so, it seems unlikely that a single gene could 
affect all the processes influenced by salinity. What is most likely is that the 
transference and expression, in a co-ordinated way, of a series of genes, each of 
which would affect one of the principal mechanisms of the process, would pro-
duce tolerant plants. The problem is that there is still not a clear idea of which 
genes have to be transferred.
When considering the future targets in this field, one can argue that rather than 
looking for salt tolerant-related genes in salt sensitive species, like arabidopsis, it 
would be better to focus on halotolerant plants. Flowers and Colmer (2008)
Found CASE 2 (halotolerant) species that are rep-
resentative of the various mechanisms that might be involved in tolerance. As these 
halophytes are evolutionarily distant from the main crop species, from a breeding 
point of view it would perhaps be better to take advantage of the existence of halo-
tolerant accesions of wild species related to a given crop, as occurs in the genus 
Solanum (Cuartero et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (Barage 2002)
Found CASE 2 (Barage et al.

Found CASE 2 (Cuartero et al. 2006, and references therein). Although these methods might lead to an 
overestimation of the number of genes supposedly involved, which would make the 
identification of relevant genes among an enormous number of other genes with purely 
secondary or irrelevant functions more difficult, it is foreseeable that transcriptomic 
analysis will become a valuable tool in the near future. However, in order to fulfil the 
expectations created in this field, it would be sensible to take into account the stage of 
development at which the saline treatment is applied, to perform tissue-specific studies 
and to avoid traumatic or unnatural treatments (Munns 2005)
Found CASE 2 (Munns and Tester 2008)
Found CASE 2 (Munns and Tester 2008)
Found CASE 2 (e.g. 
halophyte) may not produce any remarkable change in gene expression (as those plants 
grow normally in that situation and tolerate salt concentrations that kill or inhibit the 
growth of the majority of glycophytes) and a low-salt treatment may just reflect an abnor-
mal situation for that species. Rather than apply these approaches either to model (salt-
sensitive) species or halophytes, it would be better to apply them in both crop species 
and halotolerant accessions of related wild species and thus, by comparison, try to 
identify the genes responsible for tolerance (Bohnert et al. 2006; Cuartero et al. 2006)

Found CASE 2 (e.g. EMS) or physical (e.g. fast neutrons) methods could provide the basis 
for advancing the knowledge of physiological processes related to salt tolerance. 
However, in the absence of obvious candidate genes, the isolation of a gene altered in 
the mutant through a positional cloning strategy requires huge effort. Fortunately, at 
present we can overcome these problems by using alternative approaches.
Insertional mutagenesis with T-DNA or transposable elements constitutes a 
basic tool for the identification of genes and the analysis of their function. With 
respect to insertional mutagenesis with T-DNA, we can approach the tagging of 
genes by using a simple construction with a marker gene. In this way, the integra-
tion of T-DNA within the structural sequence or the controlling elements of a given 
gene will lead to its disruption and the consequent loss-of-function or, depending 
of the characteristics of the T-DNA-insert, gain-of-function or change in its level of 
expression (Krysan et al. 1999)
Found CASE 2 (recessive), its 
cloning can be easier as the gene is tagged by the T-DNA.

Found CASE 2 (see ‘Experimental 
design’ above). The aim of normalisation is to remove the ‘noise’ from the data, 
while still maintaining the ability to detect significantly differentially expressed 
genes. Dual colour fluorescence microarrays require normalisation to account for 
differences between microarrays, print-tips groups and fluorescent dye channels 
(reviewed in Smyth and Speed 2003)
Found CASE 2 (reviewed Dudoit et al. 2002;

Found CASE 2 (e.g. treatment or genotype), therefore the paired t-test is 
widely applied to analyse them. Experiments with multiple categorical factors 
(e.g. genotype and time) require methods based on the analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). Once the data are appropriately normalised, it is common practice to 
apply univariate testing for each gene and calculate the Student’s t-statistics 
(Dudoit et al. 2002)
Found CASE 2 (e.g. treatment and control) equal. However, while statistical 
analysis is clearly useful it is important to retain a sense of perspective. This 
point is encapsulated by Kirk (1996)

Found CASE 2 (qRT-PCR). The advantage 
of Northern blot and RNase protection assay is that they provide a semi-quantitative 
measure as well as reveal the size of transcripts and potentially the number of 
transcripts that correspond to the probe sequence. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR is 
the most commonly used technique for validation of microarray results, due to the 
enhanced level of sensitivity (Mackay et al. 2002)

Found CASE 2 (the list of genes are available in the cited articles). Whilst generating 
list of genes can have merit, there is an increasing realisation that combining molecu-
lar data derived from microarrays with information related to metabolic pathways is 
more useful. This combination provides a powerful tool to unravel metabolic control, 
regulation and cellular response to a range of stimuli, thereby offer greater insight into 
an organism’s phenotype. The ability to link microarray data to biochemical data is 
being fostered by advances in bioinformatics: the application of Artificial Neural 
Networks as a result pathway specific analysis (also know as functional enrichment) 
is becoming popular (Curtis et al. 2005)
Found CASE 2 (human, mouse, or

Found CASE 2 (RB and LB, respec-
tively) are the only ones necessary to mediate the transfer event, the T-DNA can be 
manipulated to contain any desired sequence to be introduced in the Arabidopsis 
genome in order to facilitate transformant selection or to reveal or manipulate gene 
expression. The T-DNA used for insertional tagging usually includes a dominant 
selectable marker which confers resistance to antibiotics (typically kanamycin) or 
herbicides (generally gluphosinate). This allows the easy screening for transfor-
mants in mutagenesis experiments.
The main advantage of insertional screens is that the T-DNA-tagged genes can 
be isolated more easily than by using chemical or physical mutagens through the 
rapid identification of the genomic sequences flanking the T-DNA insertion by 
means of techniques such as plasmid rescue (Behringer and Medford 1992;

Found CASE 2 (s) is then recovered by washing the column with a competitive 
substrate or a solution that disrupts the interaction between protein and affinant 
(e.g., denaturants). While the use of antibodies directed to a specific protein 
remains the most popular affinity-based fractionation method, many other affinity 
techniques to isolate a specific class of protein or peptide have been developed. 
These methods include immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) 
containing nickel or copper ions, to capture histidine-containing peptides (Wang 
et al. 2002; Tishchenko et al. 2002)

Found CASE 2 (Fremont, California). This technology, marketed 
as the Protein-Chip system, selectively captures the proteins of interest using 
an aluminum strip with eight spots that carry different affinity adsorbents. 
The adsorbents might be nonspecific, such as cationic, anionic, hydrophobic, or 
hydrophilic materials, or highly specific, such as antibodies or receptors. Proteins 
are adsorbed from a complex mixture, unbound material and interferences are 
washed away, and bound species are analyzed by MS systems (Chapman 2002;

The mass spectrometer in general consists of three distinct components: the 
ionization source, the mass analyzer, and the detector. The ionization source is the 
region of the instrument in which the sample of interest is ionized, with a positive or 
negative charge. The mass analyzer is where ions created in the source region are 
guided through the instrument to the detector, where their m/z ration is measured. 
Two soft ionization sources-electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization (MALDI) (Karas et al. 1985)
Found CASE 2 (Q-TOF) are even more advantageous for protein identification.
Nowadays, an MS/MS coupled to a liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) 
represents the most widely used proteomic technology applied for protein identifi-
cation. It relies on separation of peptides by LC prior the analysis on MS/MS instru-
ment. A solution containing peptide is usually pushed through a capillary which is 
charged by high voltage. As the liquid leaves the capillary droplets are formed and 
analyte can pick up some of the charge as it is desolvated (Alexandrov et al. 1984)
Found CASE 2 (Q-TOF).
To elucidate even relatively simple cellular pathways, it is usually necessary to 
draw comparisons between several physiological conditions. Performing multiple 
pair-wise comparisons produces coverage gaps, since different peptides and pro-
teins would be identified in each experiment. Therefore, a multiplexed quantitative 
technology not dependent on residue specific chemistry is advantageous toward 
differential profiling of large numbers of proteins. The introduction of an MS 
based isotopic tagging methods with cysteine-specific reagents such as ICAT 
Reagent or isobaric multiplex tagging methods with amine-specific stable isotope 
reagents such as iTRAQ Reagent (Applied Biosystems) enable quantitative pro-
teomic analyses (Ross et al. 2004)

Metabolite targeted analysis, which is restricted to one or two metabolites related to •	
specific metabolic reaction that would be affected by biotic or abiotic perturbation
A term that can lead to confusion is metabonomics, which is used for NMR-clinical 
applications on tissues or biological fluids whose change in metabolite levels is the 
result of disease or therapeutic treatment.

lites synthesized by an organism (Oliver et al. 1998)

Found CASE 2 (or 
other organisms) proves to be adequate. Plant metabolites are too many, chemically 
too complex and too much different in chemical characteristics and occur in a very 
broad dynamic range of concentrations. All this implies that the analytical methods 
must be selective for the broadest possible range of metabolites, and sensitive to 
fluctuation in their quantity. As a result, no single technique is suitable for the analy-
sis of the complete plant metabolome, but a combination of techniques must be used 
(Weckwerth 2003)

Found CASE 2 (Minimum Information About a Metabolomics Experiment), 
which includes the important steps of the experimental design. After the problem 
of harvesting the plant material, follows the extraction process. Polar/non-polar 
extractions are the most frequently applied method and are performed by physical/
chemical disruption of the cells, removal of the cell pellet by centrifugation and 
distribution of metabolites to polar (methanol/water) and non-polar (chloroform) 
solvents (Dunn and Ellis 2005)
Found CASE 2 (Ryan and Robards 
2006a; Kim et al. 2006; Verpoorte et al. 2008)
Found CASE 2 (CE) 
are included in the chromatographic methods, whereas MS and NMR belong to the 
other group. As a general consideration the chromatographic techniques require some 
preliminary steps before the measurement, such as pre-fractionation or derivatization. 
Consequently, the spectrum of metabolites analyzed is not as comprehensive as it is 
for spectrometric methods. Also reproducibility is a problem connected to chromato-
graphic separation methods, different column types from different manufacturers do 
not give the same result, and the characteristics of a certain type of column will change 
over time of production, as well as of use. In most cases, the above mentioned chro-
matographic methods are coupled to MS. GC-MS and LC-MS are the most popular 
analytical tools in metabolomics, while CE-MS is gaining importance. The strategy 
is to separate the metabolites before analyzing them in the mass spectrometer.
In GC-MS the high sensitivity of MS (at “pg” level) is coupled to the high sepa-
ration efficiency of GC. But only volatile compounds can be submitted to GC analysis. 
A derivatization step prior to the analysis, like sililation, is required for hydrophilic or 
thermolabile metabolites. The generated chromatograms become much more com-
plicated by the many derivatives yielded by metabolites with more than one reactive 
site. To overcome this problem, the introduction of fast acquisition rate time-of-flight 
(TOF) instruments, sometime coupled with deconvolution softwares, optimizes the 
identification of all the compounds in the chromatogram (Dunn and Ellis 2005)
Found CASE 2 (FT-ICR)-MS, which is now applied 
to the metabolomics field (Brown et al. 2005; Murch et al. 2004; Tohge et al. 2005)
Found CASE 2 (Hall 2006)
Found CASE 2 (ESI), atmospheric 
pressure chemical ionization (APCI), atmospheric pressure ionization (API), and 
atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI). New ESI-MS instruments operate 
switching continuously between positive and negative modes during a run. This 
allows that the broadest range of molecules can be detected. To give more robust 
results, LC can be combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). 
The MS-fragmentation pattern observed add to the selectivity of the system, and 
thus to the correct identification of the peaks. A major limitation in using LC-MS is 
that the technology is not yet supported by an extensive spectral database, thus the 
metabolite identification step is more time consuming than in GC-MS. Furthermore, 
among the chromatographic methods, LC has the smallest peak capacity, meaning a 
reduced resolution of individual metabolites in the mixture (Fukusaki and Kobayashi 
2005)
Found CASE 2 (LC x LC) is normally employed in proteomics 
studies, but it has demonstrated to be a powerful technique also when applied to 
plant metabolomics research (Mondello et al. 2005; Dugo et al. 2006; van der

Found CASE 2 (Shellie et al. 2003; Hope et al. 2005; Pierce et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (CE) is gaining popularity due to the ease of application, 
the reduced costs, and the small volumes required (less than nL). It is based on the 
different electrophoretic mobilities of ions in electrophoretic media. Capillary zone 
electrophoresis (CZE) and micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) have 
been applied for the metabolomic analysis of small molecules, such as microbial 
extracts (Markuszewski et al. 2003; Soga et al. 2003; Panagiotou et al. 2005)

Found CASE 2 (NMR) spectroscopy is presently the method of choice 
for medical metabolomics (metabonomics). Changes in the metabolites composition 
of biofluids are directly investigated as resulting from disease conditions, drug activity 
or drug toxicity. Important biomarkers can thus be identified for the comparison of the 
healthy vs diseased humans. Despite the lesser sensitivity in comparison to GC and 
LC methods, NMR is widely applied to the analysis of plant metabolites. It is rapid, 
non-destructive, reproducible, and it requires very minimal sample preparation 
(Lindon et al. 2003)

Found CASE 2 (chemometrics) is thus required to obtain the 
maximum of information from such complex data. The raw data produced as chro-
matograms or NMR spectra must be first converted in a “clean” format which is 
suitable for the analysis. This step is called data processing, and it represents one of 
the most crucial and time-consuming steps of the entire data analysis. Signal deconvo-
lution, phasing, baseline correction, noise suppression, peak alignment, peak picking 
and quantification, they all guarantee a reliable comparative metabolomic analysis 
based on the sample-to-sample variability loss. In this way the raw instrumental 
data are cleaned up and ready to be submitted to the multivariate analysis (MVA).
A chromatogram, or a NMR spectrum are characterized by several hundreds peaks. 
These all represent variables in the data matrix, which is also composed by the 
observations (samples). Metabolomics data must be considered as multivariate in the 
extent that they consist of these matrixes. Like other “omics” data sets, they contain 
many more variables than samples. Sometimes the number of variables can be reduced 
by applying a bucketing procedure. The whole data set space is divided in equally sized 
subset of data (buckets or bins) and the intensities are summed within each of them 
(Holmes et al. 1994)
Found CASE 2 (Eriksson et al. 2006)
Found CASE 2 (Colquhoun 2007)
Found CASE 2 (scores). The score plot represents the graphical 
visualization of the plane, and shows similarities between the observations. The model 
can calculate as many PCs as necessary to summarize the information in a data set. 
The loading plot is geometrically built on the orientation of the PCs in relation to 
the original variables. The loading plot allows the evaluation of the influence of 
each variable (metabolite) onto the PCs (which variables are responsible for the 
pattern? How these variables ARE correlated to each other?), and to the total infor-
mation of the entire metabolome. PCA may reveal groups of observations, trends, 
or outliers, also showing the relationship between observations and variables 
(Eriksson et al. 2005)

Found CASE 2 (PLS), linear discriminant analysis 
(LDA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), k-nearest neighbour 
analysis (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are supervised methods 
generally applied to the analysis of metabolomics data. PLS is successfully used 
when the number of variables is much greater than the number of samples. In an 
analogous way as in the PCA model, PLS is also constituted by lines and planes. 
In this case the line orientations are calculated in order to optimally discriminate 
between groups (Colquhoun 2007)
Found CASE 2 (stress or perturbation), 
genetic variation, or environmental changes, can be identified through phenotypic 
differences. An example is the work of Cook et al. (2004)

Found CASE 2 (LC-MS, GC-TOF-MS) 
has been applied for the metabolome fingerprinting of field-grown tubers from 
conventional potato cultivars and genotypes bioengineered to contain high levels of 
inulin-type fructans. Conclusions were drawn with respect to the concept of “substantial 
equivalence” which is used as starting point to assess the safety of genetically modified 
food (Kuiper et al. 2002)

Found CASE 2 (Galphimia glauca) 
was determined by using NMR and multivariate data analysis was applied for differ-
entiating populations growing in different geographical areas (Cardoso-Taketa 
et al. 2008)
Found CASE 2 (sampling material, including harvesting, storing, 
extracting), through the analytical systems up to the data handling, in order not to 
include misleading data. Reproducibility, together with protocol standardization, 
must be considered as one of the primary tasks of current metabolomic techniques 
development. Only when protocols, libraries, and databases produced by different 
laboratories using different techniques will become publicly available, the metabo-
lomics field will be able to match with the other “omics”.

Found CASE 2 (i) Library screening of the mutant plant genomic 
DNA is one of the approaches for promoter cloning. The DNA fragments flanking 
the T-DNA are identified from the library and used as a probe to isolate the wild 
type genomic sequence. The above approach is cumbersome but is particularly suit-
able when tandemly repeated copies of T-DNA are present at the same location 
(Marks and Feldman 1989)
Found CASE 2 (Dilkes and Feldmann 1998; Yanofsky et al. 1990)
Found CASE 2 (iii) Compared to the above two 
methods, a more reliable and easy approach for isolating plant T-DNA flanking 
sequences is based on PCR based technique known as inverse PCR (IPCR). The 
IPCR strategy principally involves enzymatic cleavage within the T-DNA region 
followed by ligation of the fragments to facilitate self-circularization. A set of 
nested primers derived from the T-DNA border regions are used to amplify the 
flanking DNA(Ochman et al. 1988; Resminath et al. 2005b; Wei et al. 1997)
Found CASE 2 (iv) 
the thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) is perhaps the most sensitive 
technique among the all for recovering the T-DNA flanking genomic sequences. 
The technique makes use of three nested T-DNA-specific primers in one end and a 
short arbitrary degenerate (AD) primer in the other end. Three different PCR reac-
tions are performed with these primer sets. The primary PCR reaction involves 
different primer annealing temperatures and low and high stringent cycles to facili-
tate annealing of arbitrary and specific primers, respectively. This step results into 
both specific as well as nonspecific amplification of products. In the next two steps 
of PCR reactions the non-specific products are eliminated amplifying predomi-
nantly the T-DNA flanking genomic DNA (Liu et al. 1995)
Found CASE 2 (v) The other PCR-
based method of promoter cloning includes enzymatic blunting of mutant genomic 
DNA and ligation of adapters followed by amplification of the T-DNA flanking 
DNA using three nested primers specific to T-DNA and adapters (Siebert et al. 
1995)

Found CASE 2 (TFs) are DNA binding proteins, which bind to specific regu-
latory elements of a promoter in a sequence-specific manner. The TFs interact to 
these cis-sequences in a combinatorial manner in imparting spatial and temporal 
regulation of a gene (Singh 1998)
Found CASE 2 (EMSA) and foot printing techniques using 
DNaseI and dimethyl sulphate (DMS).
The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or gel shift assay is the one of 
the methods for detecting whether a given DNA sequence interactes with proteins. 
The technique involves a labeled promoter sequence incubated with cognate DNA-
binding proteins or total nuclear extract, which are then subjected to electrophoresis 
in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside an untreated DNA sequence. The 
evidence of protein binding is indicated by the differences in the electrophoretic 
mobility of the protein bound and free DNA molecules. The protein-bound DNA 
migrates slower than the free DNA. The EMSA as a tool has been employed in 
several plant promoter analyses (Abe et al. 2001; Hettiarachchi et al. 2003; Kim and 
Guiltinan 1999; Meister et al. 2004; Tucker et al. 2002)

Found CASE 2 (ZFN) provide an attractive tool for improving the efficiency 
of gene targeting because they can be designed to recognize naturally any DNA 
sequence. By inducing DSBs at pre-defined locations, they can stimulate the cell’s 
endogenous HR machinery to incorporate exogenous DNA by homologous recom-
bination. The zinc finger is a compact protein module that has a remarkably simple 
mode of interaction with DNA, making it ideal for protein engineering (Choo and 
Isalan 2000)

Found CASE 2 (CMS). In, for example, Brassica 
vegetables like Chinese cabbage, which are grown for their vegetative parts, the 
hybrid plant can still be male sterile without influencing yield negatively. In other 
crops like maize and rice, where seeds are the end product, restoration of male 
fertility is needed. In such cases, restorer genes (Rf) are very important. In practise, 
these Rf genes are complicating variety development considerably. In recent 
years a lot of knowledge has been obtained about the molecular genetic base of 
CMS as well as Rf genes (Wise and Pring 2002)

Found CASE 2 (Ruiz

Found CASE 2 (GI) and sporophytic (SI) 
self-incompatibility. The GI system can be based on one locus (cabbage, red clover) 
with many alleles or on two loci (grasses). The gametophytic one-locus self-
incompatibility is molecularly well investigated. It results from the interaction 
between the haploid genotype of the pollen grain and the diploid genotype of the 
style. Inhibition is found in the style. The S-alleles in the style work independently. 
It is known that polyploidization restores self-compatibility.
Plants belonging to the Compositae family do possess the SI system. This is 
usually based on one gene with multiple alleles. The interaction is dependent on 
the diploid maternal genotype of the pollinator and the diploid genotype of the 
style. Inhibition is found on the stigma. Reaction of the pollen is determined by the 
dominance relationship of the sporophyte and not by the gametophyte. For hybrid 
breeding the SI system is frequently used in vegetable crops of Brassica oleracea.
Molecular research on GI of, for example, Petunia inflata brought new possibili-
ties for influencing self-incompatibility (McClure 2006)

Found CASE 2 (unpublished 
observations) which still provides in the Netherlands total resistance however, in trap 
fields virulent isolates of late blight  have already been isolated (Kessel, pers. 
comm). Therefore, only one R-gene in a variety is dangerous because of potential 
breakage problems. The philosophy has to be to stack several major R-genes from 
different sources at the same time in one genotype (Jacobsen and Vossen 2008)

Found CASE 2 (DUBS) process the ubiquitin fusions into their respec-
tive, functional components. The deubiquitinating enzymes are specific for ubiq-
uitin and can remove most proteins joined to the ubiquitin C-terminus. Thus, in 
yeast, fusion constructs where two proteins are connected in-frame with a single Ub 
sequence have been shown to be cleaved after the last residue of Ub to yield 
equimolar amounts of the two proteins, with the anterior one carrying the C-terminal 
Ub unit (Levy et al. 1996; Suzuki and Varshavsky 1999)

Found CASE 2 (Napoli et al. 1990)
Found CASE 2 (CHS) is a key enzyme in the 
anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway and the introduction of an extra copy of chsA 
into a purple-flowered petunia line was expected to yield plants bearing flowers of 
more intense color. In practice, white-flowered progeny were obtained and it was 
subsequently discovered that the mRNAs from both the host chsA gene and 
homologous transgenes were degraded (“co-suppressed”) following transcription 
in the nucleus, accounting for the lack of CHS expression. This co-suppression 
phenomenon has now been observed in many other organisms, notably in 
Neurospora crassa (Cogoni and Macino 1999)

Found CASE 2 (TGS) or at the post-transcrip-
tional (PTGS) level. Useful generalizations, to which there are many exceptions, 
are that: whereas in TGS the promoter is methylated and no mRNA is transcribed 
from the transgene, in PTGS, although the coding sequences are methylated, the 
mRNA is transcribed but is rapidly degraded (Kooter et al. 1999; Matzke and 
Matzke 1995; Vaucheret et al. 1998)
Found CASE 2 (either by Northern blot, nuclear run-on or RNase protection assays) 
appears to provide de facto evidence for TGS. However, it is now recognized that 
the initiating step could be a short-lived PTGS event that sets up a more long-lived 
TGS system. TGS is both mitotically and meiotically heritable, whereas PTGS 
is reversed following meiosis (Depicker and Montagu 1997; Stam et al. 1998)

Found CASE 2 (also known as secondary metabolites) 
participate in the interaction of the plant with the environment, and serve multiple 
tasks in plant reproduction as for example in alluring pollinators and frugivores.

Found CASE 2 (MS)-based technologies that permit the measurement of the masses 
of individual ions are currently the most commonly used detection methods for 
small molecules. MS allows the sensitive detection and identification of metabolites 
through the interpretation of mass spectrum and determination of molecular formu-
lae via accurate mass measurements (Dunn et al. 2005)

Found CASE 2 (Fragaria) belongs to the subfamily Rosoideae of the Rosaceae 
family that includes other known fruit species including apples, pears, plums, peaches 
and raspberries. Fruit of the Rosaceae family are known to have exceptionally rich 
secondary metabolite composition upon ripening. The ripe stage of strawberry devel-
opment is well documented with respect to its metabolite composition (Koponen 
et al. 2007; Puupponen-Pimiä et al. 2005; Hannum 2004)

Found CASE 2 (continuous flow) injection and ionized by either electrospray 
ionization (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in both posi-
tive or negative ionization modes. Changes in the levels of known fruit compounds, 
as well as putative compounds not previously associated with strawberry fruit devel-
opment, revealed novel information on the metabolic transition from immature to 
ripe fruit. Integrating the data on metabolism during the early stages of strawberry 
fruit development revealed the accumulation of compounds that serve as raw mate-
rial and building blocks for the production of ripening-associated metabolites. For 
example, the relative high levels of various organic, phenolic and amino acids in 
unripe fruit may serve as precursors for the formation of aromatic/phenolic compo-
nents, while other amino acids such as glutamine may be used for the production of 
nitrogen-containing metabolites. Oxidative breakdown of the accumulated unsatu-
rated fatty acids may result in the biosynthesis of aroma compounds (i.e. aldehydes, 
alcohols and esters). Carbon skeletons produced in the TCA cycle may be used to 
synthesise certain amino acids that, in turn, can be converted into more complex, 
secondary metabolites. A most important output of these experiments was that the 
method described could simultaneously and rapidly detect masses putatively corre-
sponding to various types of compounds known to accumulate during ripening of 
strawberry fruit. Ripening associated metabolites that could be detected included 
flavour compounds such as furans, ester derivatives (aldehydes, alcohols and esters), 
terpenes, carbohydrates, anthocyanins and different other phenolics.
A recent, extensive survey of both primary and secondary metabolism in strawberry 
receptacle and achene tissues during development was carried out by combining 
LC-MS and GC-MS–based metabolite profiling (Fait et al. 2008)

Found CASE 2 (or metabolite classes) and their function in fruit 
physiology. The results up to now also highlight the strong link between secondary 
and primary metabolism. Apart from extending metabolomics to other fruit species 
it is also expected that future studies will be able to follow metabolism in various 
fruit cell layers and even cell compartments.

Found CASE 2 (i) useful genes (or molecular 
tools) to improve plants, (ii) plant transformation systems, and (iii) artificial 
regulation of trans- or endogenous genes in a transgenic plant. The advantage 
of plant breeding by genetic engineering (often called molecular breeding) is 
that plant breeders are not bound by the limits of the genetic diversity of a spe-
cific species; with genetic engineering, they can incorporate any genes from 
any organism to generate a variety with a novel character that is often highly 
appreciated by consumers.
In this chapter, we will describe what has been achieved in the field of molecular 
breeding of floricultural crops with a special focus on consumer traits, as called by 
Chandler and Tanaka (2007)

Found CASE 2 (GM) plants. Among these steps, it is noteworthy to 
stress the importance of plant transformation. Since the performance of a transgene 
greatly depends on the transgenic lines, many (from dozens to hundreds) transgenic 
lines containing the same transgene have to be generated to obtain lines exhibiting 
desirable phenotypes, and thus it is essential to establish an efficient transformation 
system. However, the plant transformation efficiency depends on the species and 
cultivars to a large extent. Tedious and laborious efforts for many years are often 
necessary to optimize transformation protocols. Transformable floricultural crops have 
been summarized in reviews (Chandler and Tanaka 2007; Tanaka et al. 2005)

Since carotenoids are essential components of photosystems and carotenoids and 
phytohormones including gibberellic acid and absidic acid partly share the biosyn-
thetic pathway, engineering a carotenoid pathway may have a detrimental effect 
and be more challenging than engineering a flavonoid pathway. Owing to their 
nutrient values, more attention has been given to carotenoid engineering in edible 
crops than in flowers (Tanaka and Omiya 2008)

Found CASE 2 (Poa pratensis L.) have been widely used for amenity purpose on lawns, parks, 
sports field, golf course and roadsides. In addition to food and environment, 
recently some of grasses showing high biomass such as switchgrass (Panicum 
virgatum L.) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) have been given 
attention to renewable biomass energy crops as a possible alternative to fossil 
fuels. Otherwise forage legumes such as white clover (Trifolium repens L.), red 
clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) are important spe-
cies, providing high quality herbage with nitrogen fixation. Forage legumes are 
essential for sustainable grasslands agriculture.
New forage crop cultivars which developed through genetic improvement have 
a long history of positively impacting forage and livestock systems. Traditional 
breeding methods such as phenotypic evaluation, selection and hybridization have 
always been, and still continue to be, used. However, forage crop breeding pro-
grams have entered the biotechnology era using molecular biology tools. Molecular 
breeding is therefore a relatively new term that describes the use of transgenic and 
genomic biotechnologies in a conjunction with traditional breeding programs

choice due to their abundance, ubiquitous distribution in plant genomes, high level 
of reproducibility, ease of PCR-based analysis, and detection of co-dominant mul-
tiallelic loci. Thus, SSR markers have been developed in forage crops such as 
perennial ryegrass (Jones et al. 2001; Kubik et al. 2001; Asp et al. 2007; Jensen
