Found CASE 2 (du-
ration of vegetative and reproductive phase, budding 
and flowering, tuber mass, tuber number and yield 
per plant), which confirms the existence of genetic 
variability among accessions.
Most of the analyzed accessions originated 
from Montenegro. By analyzing the influence of day 
length on flowering initiation and the length of the 
vegetative phase, it was found that their variability 
was lower than in accessions from the uSA and cul-
tivars. Accessions originating from the uSA can be 
considered as typical representatives of the species 
from its natural habitat and the center of origin. That 
is why it could be expected for them to show greater 
variability than a group of accessions that after in-
troduction, remained on the relatively small area of 
Montenegro (Dozet et al., 1993; vasić et al., 2002)

Found CASE 2 (FMI) keeps producing
leaves with associated shoots after the transition to
reproductive development has occurred. This re-
view deals with the molecular mechanisms that
cause the reprogramming of primordia during this
transition. Most of the discussion will be focused
on Arabidopsis, but there will be reference to work

Found CASE 2 (flowering time) and the determi-

1997)
Found CASE 2 (CEN),
the most likely ortholog in Antirrhinum, is only
expressed in the inflorescence meristem and reces-
sive mutations in this gene alter the determination
but not flowering time (Bradley et al., 1996)
Found CASE 2 (LF), which acts only as a
repressor of flowering, and DETERMINATE
(DET) which exclusively controls inflorescence
determination. The spatial expression pattern of
these genes has not been analyzed in detail, but
RT-PCR data show that LF is expressed both in
vegetative and inflorescence apices, while DET is
only expressed in inflorescence apices (Foucher
et al., 2003)

Considerations of floral termination and
plant architecture
Growth habit in plants is described by two fundamental
models, monopodial and sympodial. Both growth habits are
found in families of the most primitive plants, such as
liverworts, mosses, and cycads (Bell, 1992)

Found CASE 2 (see
later) balance flowering promoting signals, and regulators
of transmission per se, may also play a role. The rescue of
flowering, under short days, by wild-type donors may be
difficult in Arabidopsis as well, but in species where
efficient auto-regulation or relay-amplification mechanisms
evolved, uninduced wild-type donors may work.
SFT generates universal florigenic signals
Variations in responses to florigenic stimulus, presumably
due to different components of a mechanism shared by all
plants, or to independent ‘florigens’ operating differentially
in different plants (Bernier, 1988)

Found CASE 2 (Lifschitz E and Eshed
Y unpublished data). Thus, all responses stimulated by the
SFT to SP balance involve changes in growth, suggesting
that floral transition and growth attenuation, instead of
being the consequence of one another, are two facets of the
same cellular responses. Since all the facets of the SFT/SP
ratio are also graft-transmissible, it is speculated that
growth and termination are targets for florigen-compatible
signals and that boosting flowering is a pleiotropic effect of
FT orthologues (Lifschitz et al., 2006)

response to multiple flowering signals and eventually differentiate
into various types of floral organ, the regulation of FM development
is a crucial and dynamic switch that allows for the successful

environment.

Found CASE 2 (donor) via a graft union to a non-

Found CASE 2 (flower-former) for this floral stimulus, which
he defined as specific substances with a regulatory function.
Grafting experiments between related species, but of a dif-
ferent photoperiodic response type (e.g., a short-day plant
[SDP] and a long-day plant [LDP]), provided evidence for ex-
changeability of florigen among different response types. This
earlier work showing that florigen is functionally conserved in
different species has been extensively reviewed (Lang, 1965;
Zeevaart, 1976)
Found CASE 2 (at least in closely related species and
different photoperiodic response types). However, despite
numerous attempts to extract florigen and several reports of
extracts with flower-inducing activity, which all turned out to be
nonreproducible, florigen remained a physiological concept
rather than a chemical entity. As a result, the florigen hypoth-
esis fell into disrepute, and a rival hypothesis, proposing that
flowering would be induced by a specific ratio of known
hormones and metabolites, gained favor (Bernier, 1988;
Bernier et al., 1993)
Found CASE 2 (GA) flowering response pathways (Mouradov et al.,
2002; Périlleux and Bernier, 2002; Komeda, 2004; Corbesier and
Coupland, 2005)
Found CASE 2 (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). CO encodes
a nuclear zinc-finger protein, which in response to LD induces
transcription of FT, encoding a RAF-kinase-inhibitor-like protein.
Neither of these genes is expressed to any extent in the shoot
apex. Expression from meristem-specific promoters of CO does
not promote flowering, but early flowering is induced in plants in
SD when FT is overexpressed in the meristem. Expression of CO
only in the phloem is sufficient to generate a phloem-mobile
signal, as shown by grafting experiments with Arabidopsis (An
et al., 2004; Ayre and Turgeon, 2004)

Found CASE 2 (at least in Arabidopsis). The objection can
be raised that FT itself is not the final stimulus, but only induces
another factor essential for flowering that moves along with FT
transcripts from leaf to shoot apex (An et al., 2004; Huang et al.,

Found CASE 2 (Zeevaart, 1958)
Found CASE 2 (e.g.,
Xanthium strumarium and Bryophyllum daigremontianum) in
which flowering receptor shoots become effective donors
themselves. This phenomenon, called indirect induction or non-
localized induction, suggests that florigen has self-perpetuating
properties (for review, see Zeevaart, 1976)
Found CASE 2 (2005)
Found CASE 2 (below the graft union) is the donor, and the scion
(above the graft union) is the receptor. Arrows point toward the graft
unions. In each case, the appropriate photoperiodic conditions were
used to induce flowering of the donor plant, whereas the receptor was in
a noninductive photoperiod. None of the control grafts with noninduced
donors caused flowering in the receptors (data not shown).

Found CASE 2 (mRNA or protein) that is
required for flowering.
Little work on flowering has been performed with DNPs
because their flowering cannot be controlled at will. However,
recent work with tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) demonstrates
that flowering in this DNP is also induced by a transmissible
signal, generated by the ortholog of FT, SINGLE-FLOWER
TRUSS (SFT) (Lifschitz et al., 2006)
Found CASE 2 (Nicotiana tabacum) or tomato induced
early flowering in both species. Moreover, overexpression of
SFT induced flowering in the SDP Maryland Mammoth tobacco
in LD and in Arabidopsis under SD. Transmission of florigen via
grafts was obtained from tomato overexpressing SFT (donor) to
sft mutant plants, to MarylandMammoth tobacco in LD, and to a
tomato mutant uf that does not flower under low irradiance. SFT
was expressed in the leaves, and its protein wasmainly localized
in the nuclei of leaf cells. No evidence was obtained for
movement of SFT mRNA from donor leaves to receptor shoots,
so that it was proposed that in tomato, florigen is a signal
downstream of SFT (Lifschitz et al., 2006)
Found CASE 2 (if it crosses the graft union at all) and also that, unlike
in Arabidopsis (see above), an SFT autoregulatory loop does not
function in tomato. So, although there may be differences
between different species and photoperiodic response types, all
have in common that either FT, or a product of FT, is the flower-
inducing signal.
There are many examples of successful transmission of
florigen between different species (see above), but there are also
many examples in which the receptor shoots did not flower
(Zeevaart, 1976)
Found CASE 2 (Lifschitz et al., 2006)

to produce sufficient florigen, whereas apical meristems of
juvenile plants can respond to florigen with flowering (Zeevaart,

WARNING - Could not find in-text citations for document - CASE 1
Found CASE 2 (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa), and a
temperate origin grass, wheat (Triticum aestivum), pro-
vides most of the world’s food. Other grasses, such as
barley (Hordeum vulgare), ryegrass species (Lolium
spp.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and oats (Avena
sativa), are grown in lesser amounts, but also fill
important food production niches. In grass species,
such as sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), the vegetative
portion of the plant is harvested for the Suc that
accumulates in its stalks; in this crop, the inability to
flower is desirable because sugar levels drop after
plants make the transition to flowering as carbon
assimilates are shunted to seed production. In all of
these grasses, manipulation of the timing of the floral
transition is a vitally important trait in maximizing
yield potential. Extensive agronomic studies have
been done on grass species, but studies of the small
flowering dicot plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thali-
ana) have provided an abundance of information on
the genetic and molecular control of flowering. What
has emerged is a complex network of genes and
pathways, some parts of which are also found in the
grasses. Conversely, recent discoveries show that
grasses also have developed unique mechanisms to
regulate flowering.
RIGHT TIME, RIGHT PLACE: FEATURES OF THE
FLORAL TRANSITION
With regard to the floral transition, all higher plants
share some common mechanisms that control this
important switch fromvegetative to reproductive growth

Migration of crop grasses into different latitudes
required that they adopt other signals to induce
flowering so that they could adapt to different grow-
ing seasons. Because the underlying principle of
flowering time is the synchronization of the plant’s
internal rhythms with environmental conditions, al-
terations in daylength associated with seasonal
changes are among the most accurate cues to deter-
mine the right time to flower. In grasses, it is clear that
the core photoperiod response pathway is largely
conserved with Arabidopsis, albeit less well under-
stood (Laurie et al., 2004; Turck et al., 2008)

Found CASE 2 (i.e. vernalization). This is an adaptive
trait that prevents seeds sown in late summer or early
fall from flowering until the next spring, thereby
delaying flowering until the spring rather than just
before a possibly harsh winter. Analyses of mutants
that interfere with this vernalization response have
defined a separate pathway in the flowering model
(for review, see Sung and Amasino, 2005)
Found CASE 2 (FLC) gene has been identified as a
central flowering repressor whose activity is reduced
by vernalization. FLC encodes a MADS-box transcrip-
tion factor that represses flowering by directly inter-
fering with FT expression in leaves and FD expression

a florigen and conveys the information to induce flowering from
the leaves to the shoot meristem (Wigge et al., 2005; Corbesier et

Found CASE 2 (sometimes all) of what would otherwise be vegetative
shoots into flowers. Most of these recent advances in
understanding flowering have come from the use of
molecular genetic techniques on annual plants, parti-
cularly Arabidopsis thaliana (commonly known as
Arabidopsis), which are well suited to this type of
investigation. Nevertheless, as the results obtained
from these plants have been extended to crop plants,
including perennials, it has become increasingly clear
that the formation of the structures that comprise a
typical flower, such as sepals, petals, stamens and
carpels, is largely conserved across all flowering
plants, with relatively minor variations in the activity
of key developmental genes accounting for the
observed variation in flower morphology (Goto et al.

The nature of this mobile flowering signal, often referred
to as florigen, has long been the subject of research.
Recent work in Arabidopsis has suggested that products
of the FLOWERING TIME (FT) gene may be at least part
of this mobile signal (Abe et al. 2005, Huang et al.
