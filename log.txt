Found CASE 2 [40]. The pH values of the initial mixture were 10.2 and 7.98,
respectively. Increasing this ratio to 3.0 and then further to 4.0 re-
sulted in the formation of a pure 3D anionic aluminophosphate
AlPO-JU88 [41]. The pH values of the initial mixtures reached
7.45 and 6.18, respectively. With a further increase of this ratio
to 5.0, layered anionic aluminophosphate AP2pip appeared in addi-
tion to AlPO-JU88. The pH of the initial mixture was 4.78. When
this ratio was increased to 5.5 and 6.0, the pH values of the initial
mixture were decreased to 4.7 and 4.61, respectively, and pure
AP2pip was obtained [42]. The pH of the initial mixture was in
the range of 4.26–3.31 when this ratio fell in the range of 7.0–
8.0. In addition to a 3D anionic aluminophosphate AlPO-CJ11/
AlPO-CJB2 [43,44], an unidentified phase was obtained as well.
Therefore, we only investigated the crystallization processes of
AlPO-CJ9, AlPO-JU88, and AP2pip. The compositions of the initial

activation25. In addition, several infectious pathogens target IFN-g–
induced expression of MHC2TA to escape the immune system26.
Despite the wealth of data concerning the role of MHC2TA in the
transcriptional regulation of immune-related proteins, involvement in
the regulation of susceptibility to immune-related human disease has
not previously been documented to our knowledge. This may be due
to the fact that the genes contributing to complex diseases have
modest impacts requiring large case-control studies to obtain suffi-
cient statistical power27. This may be why some studies in small
clinical samples did not show association of MHC2TA with auto-
immune diseases28–30. On the basis of these results, it has been
hypothesized that differences in the level of expression of MHC
class II molecules stem from polymorphisms in the MHC class II
promoters proper and that functional polymorphisms in MHC2TA
would have too broad a spectrum of effects to be advantageous for
an individual29.
Our results conflict with this view as they identify two functional rat
haplotypes in Mhc2ta shared by strains that express MHC class II
molecules at low and high levels, respectively. In addition, the fact that
expression of MHC class II molecules differs between strains after both
mechanical injury and classic inflammatory stimuli argues for a direct
effect on class II transcription, in concordance
with the described properties of Mhc2ta.
Functional polymorphisms in MHC2TA and
thereby differential expression of MHC
class II molecules could affect many inflam-
matory conditions, such as autoimmune
responses. This idea is strengthened by the
finding of an association of MHC2TA poly-
morphisms with susceptibility to three human
diseases with known inflammatory compo-
nents. In vitro stimulation experiments sug-
gest that the risk allele is associated with
reduced induction of MHC class II genes by
inflammatory stimuli. If the effect on disease
is mediated through the differential induction
of MHC molecules, either high expression of
MHC molecules may protect against disease
or, alternatively, low expression of MHC
molecules may promote disease. In the latter
case, the pathogenic mechanism may be
related to a less efficient presentation of anti-
gens to protective, regulatory T cells. Studies
suggest that such T cells exist in all three
categories of diseases studied here: nervous
tissue–specific autoimmune T cells may, under certain conditions, be
involved in repair rather than damage, perhaps through the production
of neurotrophins31,32; regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells have been
characterized in rheumatoid arthritis33; and CD4+ T cells may be
antiatherogenic in experimental atherosclerosis34.
A further speculation along this line is that low levels of expression
of MHC2TA may characterize separate disease entities within the
clinically categorized syndromes. Our genetic analysis gave the highest
degree of association using a dominant model. In contrast, the out-
come of the in vitro stimulation experiment suggested a recessive effect.
Disease susceptibility is a much more complex feature than the
phenotype studied in vitro. Furthermore, because MHC2TA also
regulates the transcription of a number of non-MHC genes, the
involved pathways may differ19. Even if the increase in disease suscept-
ibility conferred by the risk allele is relatively modest, the outcome is
concordant in the samples we studied. Samples from individuals with
multiple sclerosis were associated with disease when compared with the
pooled control material as well as the population-based controls from
the rheumatoid arthritis study, but not when compared with controls
recruited from healthy blood donors. This discordance may reflect the
fact that healthy blood donors, based on a number of exclusion criteria
