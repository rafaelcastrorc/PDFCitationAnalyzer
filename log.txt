Found CASE 2 [40]. The pH values of the initial mixture were 10.2 and 7.98,
respectively. Increasing this ratio to 3.0 and then further to 4.0 re-
sulted in the formation of a pure 3D anionic aluminophosphate
AlPO-JU88 [41]. The pH values of the initial mixtures reached
7.45 and 6.18, respectively. With a further increase of this ratio
to 5.0, layered anionic aluminophosphate AP2pip appeared in addi-
tion to AlPO-JU88. The pH of the initial mixture was 4.78. When
this ratio was increased to 5.5 and 6.0, the pH values of the initial
mixture were decreased to 4.7 and 4.61, respectively, and pure
AP2pip was obtained [42]. The pH of the initial mixture was in
the range of 4.26–3.31 when this ratio fell in the range of 7.0–
8.0. In addition to a 3D anionic aluminophosphate AlPO-CJ11/
AlPO-CJB2 [43,44], an unidentified phase was obtained as well.
Therefore, we only investigated the crystallization processes of
AlPO-CJ9, AlPO-JU88, and AP2pip. The compositions of the initial

activation25. In addition, several infectious pathogens target IFN-g–
induced expression of MHC2TA to escape the immune system26.
Despite the wealth of data concerning the role of MHC2TA in the
transcriptional regulation of immune-related proteins, involvement in
the regulation of susceptibility to immune-related human disease has
not previously been documented to our knowledge. This may be due
to the fact that the genes contributing to complex diseases have
modest impacts requiring large case-control studies to obtain suffi-
cient statistical power27. This may be why some studies in small
clinical samples did not show association of MHC2TA with auto-
immune diseases28–30. On the basis of these results, it has been
hypothesized that differences in the level of expression of MHC
class II molecules stem from polymorphisms in the MHC class II
promoters proper and that functional polymorphisms in MHC2TA
would have too broad a spectrum of effects to be advantageous for
an individual29.
Our results conflict with this view as they identify two functional rat
haplotypes in Mhc2ta shared by strains that express MHC class II
molecules at low and high levels, respectively. In addition, the fact that
expression of MHC class II molecules differs between strains after both
mechanical injury and classic inflammatory stimuli argues for a direct
effect on class II transcription, in concordance
with the described properties of Mhc2ta.
Functional polymorphisms in MHC2TA and
thereby differential expression of MHC
class II molecules could affect many inflam-
matory conditions, such as autoimmune
responses. This idea is strengthened by the
finding of an association of MHC2TA poly-
morphisms with susceptibility to three human
diseases with known inflammatory compo-
nents. In vitro stimulation experiments sug-
gest that the risk allele is associated with
reduced induction of MHC class II genes by
inflammatory stimuli. If the effect on disease
is mediated through the differential induction
of MHC molecules, either high expression of
MHC molecules may protect against disease
or, alternatively, low expression of MHC
molecules may promote disease. In the latter
case, the pathogenic mechanism may be
related to a less efficient presentation of anti-
gens to protective, regulatory T cells. Studies
suggest that such T cells exist in all three
categories of diseases studied here: nervous
tissue–specific autoimmune T cells may, under certain conditions, be
involved in repair rather than damage, perhaps through the production
of neurotrophins31,32; regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells have been
characterized in rheumatoid arthritis33; and CD4+ T cells may be
antiatherogenic in experimental atherosclerosis34.
A further speculation along this line is that low levels of expression
of MHC2TA may characterize separate disease entities within the
clinically categorized syndromes. Our genetic analysis gave the highest
degree of association using a dominant model. In contrast, the out-
come of the in vitro stimulation experiment suggested a recessive effect.
Disease susceptibility is a much more complex feature than the
phenotype studied in vitro. Furthermore, because MHC2TA also
regulates the transcription of a number of non-MHC genes, the
involved pathways may differ19. Even if the increase in disease suscept-
ibility conferred by the risk allele is relatively modest, the outcome is
concordant in the samples we studied. Samples from individuals with
multiple sclerosis were associated with disease when compared with the
pooled control material as well as the population-based controls from
the rheumatoid arthritis study, but not when compared with controls
recruited from healthy blood donors. This discordance may reflect the
fact that healthy blood donors, based on a number of exclusion criteria

Found CASE 2 [1,2]. However this
proved frustratingly difficult to demonstrate [3,4].
Despite many attempts, it is only relatively re-
cently that H3+ has been detected in the ISM [5];
in the meantime H3+ has been detected spectro-
scopically in environments where its presence had
been less anticipated [6–10]. In this article we
discuss how a detailed understanding of the spec-
troscopy of H3+ has led to significant advances in
various fields and what the future may hold.
2. Spectroscopy of H3+
By molecular standards, H3+ is a simple system.
It comprises three protons which share equally
two electrons. Its equilibrium geometry is an equi-
lateral triangle. But it is a fairly floppy system
undergoing large-amplitude vibrational motion.
For example H3+ can become linear at only about
a third of its dissociation energy of 4.3 eV. For
this reason H3+ spectra do not conform to many
of the standard rules of spectroscopy and the
analysis of observed spectra has relied heavily on
ab initio theory [11].
No electronic spectrum of H3+ has ever been
observed. The high symmetry of H3+ means that it
has no permanent dipole and as a result no rota-
tional spectrum has ever been observed either.
However H3+ is predicted to have a weak, strongly
J-dependent spectrum which arises from the small
dipole created as the molecule distorts in response
to rotatating about one particular axis [12,13].
Some astronomical consequences of this are dis-
cussed below.
This leaves infrared vibration–rotation spectra
as the only present spectroscopy handle on the
H3+ problem. Again because of its high symmetry,
H3+ has only one infrared-active fundamental, a
degenerate bending mode whose band origin lies
at 2521 cm−1. Fifteen lines in the n2 fundamental
were originally observed by Oka [14], close to the
ab initio predictions of Carney and Porter [15].
Fortunately most n2 transitions lie in the 3–4-mm
region [20] which is in the L window in the
Earth’s atmosphere. This makes them amenable
to ground-based astronomical observation. A
comprehensive review of the laboratory spec-
troscopy of H3+ has been given by McNab [21].
3. Planetary
It took many years of searching before a spec-
trum of the only infrared-active fundamental of
H3+, the bending mode, was detected in the labo-
ratory by Oka [14]. Yet the first detection of an
astronomical spectrum of H3+ was of an overtone
spectrum [6]. This serendipitous detection was
made during observations of H2 quadrupole emis-
sions in the aurora near the south pole of Jupiter.
The spectrum was assigned largely on the basis of
ab initio theoretical calculations [16]. Such calcu-
lations had predicted that overtone emissions
should be strong [17].
The observation of an H3+ spectrum in Jupiter
was not altogether a surprise, as H3+ has already
been detected in situ by the charged-particle de-
tector carried on the Voyager mission [18]. How-
ever the H3+ spectrum contained and continues to
contain many surprises and much information.
Initial fits to the H3+ spectrum of Drossart et al.
[6] suggested a rotational temperature of about
1100 K. This temperature was significantly higher
than that expected for Jupiter’s aurora [19]. Simi-
lar temperatures were obtained by analysing vi-
brational state distributions [22,23] and the
translational motion via Doppler profiles [24].
Interestingly, some models of H3+ in Jupiter’s
ionosphere suggest that the appearance that H3+ is
thermalized in the Jovian ionosphere may be an
illusion [25]. These models predict that the ground
state should be overpopulated. This conclusion
could be tested by observations of the weak
ground-state pure-rotational spectrum. Such an

Found CASE 2 (2001)
Found CASE 2 [33] showed, in
some cases, pronounced Doppler shifts in the
emissions. These shifts suggested supersonic mo-
tions and provided the first observational confir-
mation of a long-standing model of Jupiter’s
aurora [34].
Jupiter is not on the only gas giant from which
H3+ emissions can be observed: spectra have been
obtained from both Uranus [8] and Saturn [9].
Some interesting results are beginning to emerge
from these studies [35]. For example, as shown in
Fig. 1, the H3+ emission on Uranus is much more
widespread and diffuse than it is on Jupiter. How-
ever it remains to be seen if the study of H3+
spectra on the other gas giants will prove as
rewarding as it has done for Jupiter.
Initially, studies of H3+ emissions from Jupiter
used the ion as an interesting spectroscopic tool to
probe the physical environment of Jupiter’s upper
atmosphere. However it has become apparent that
for both Jupiter [36] and Uranus [8] that H3+
emissions are actually an important component in
the energy balance of the planet. This situation is
similar to the atmospheres of cool stars whose
properties and behaviour have long been known
to be sensitive to the details of the spectra of their
constituent molecules.
4. Stellar atmospheres etc
The spectra of cool stars are usually dominated
by molecular absorptions, which are often
difficult to model because of the sheer volume of
laboratory or computed data that is required to
synthesize reliable spectra at temperatures of
2000–4000 K [37]. The spectra of most cool stars
local to us are dominated by absorptions due to
molecules containing either oxygen or carbon,
depending of the elemental abundance of the star.
However in the early Universe stars must have
formed containing hydrogen and helium only.
The spectra and chemistry of these ‘metal-free’
stars is very different [38]. Molecular hydrogen is
a very inefficient absorber of infrared radiation
and other means have to be found to explain the
radiation transport in these bodies. It would ap-
pear that the dominant absorber of infrared pho-
tons is H− [54]. However the stellar atmospheres
are electrically neutral and in cool metal-free stars
H3+, as the dominant hydrogenic molecular ion, is
J. Tennyson, S. Miller / Spectrochimica Acta Part A 57 (2001)
Found CASE 2 [7]. Although the assignment of H3+ in the
aftermath of SN1987a was supported by chemical
models, it remained controversial. Recently Yan
and Dalgarno [43] have constructed a much more
detailed chemical, and in particular clumpy,
model of the SN1987a ejecta. This model confirms
the assignment of H3+ and successfully replicates
its time dependence. In the absence of other plau-
sible candidates for what is a strong spectrum, the
assignment of H3+ in SN1987a must be regarded
as secure.
5. Interstellar medium
H3+ has long been regarded as the main driver
of chemical reactions in the ISM [1,2]. However,
given the low temperatures prevalent in the ISM,
Fig. 2. Comparison of stellar models with different H3
+ parti-
tion functions. Model A used the partition function of Chan-
dra et al. [40]; model B used the partition function of Neale
and Tennyson [41]. Besides the much improved fit given by
model B, note that the effective stellar temperature is 500-K
lower.
J. Tennyson, S. Miller / Spectrochimica Acta Part A 57 (2001)
Found CASE 2 [44]. This observation is made difficult by
the sparsity of the infrared spectrum of cold H3+,
telluric absorptions in the infrared and the need
for a suitably positioned star. A number of at-
tempts to observe H3+ in this fashion failed [44–
46]. In the meantime we proposed an alternative
strategy of looking for H3+ emissions from
warmer, possibly shocked, regions of the ISM.
Searches based on this strategy also failed [47].
Recently, Geballe and Oka [5,48] successfully
detected H3+ absorption against starlight in a
number of dense molecular clouds. Much to the
relief of the modeling community, these observa-
tions found H3+ column densities in the range
expected by most chemical models. However fur-
ther observations by Geballe, Oka and their co-
workers [10,49] also found the clear spectra
signature of H3+ in diffuse interstellar clouds.
These much harsher environments were not ex-
pected to support column densities of H3+ close to
those found in dense clouds, even when one al-
lows for the much larger size of the diffuse clouds.
Modeling these observations thus presents a real
challenge.
So far all spectroscopic observations of H3+,
both laboratory and astronomical, have relied on
vibration–rotation spectra. Recently Black [50]
has pointed out that two of the lower-lying, and
hence weaker, rotational transitions of H3+ lie at
long enough wavelengths to be observable from
the ground. These are 4,4-3,1 at 7.261 cm−1 and
7,6-6,3 at 9.252 cm−1. These frequencies come
from the experimental energy levels compiled by
Dinelli et al. [51], although it is Black’s contention
that these are not accurate enough for viable
astronomical searches. More intriguing is Black’s
speculation that the transition at 217.8 GHz could
well mase. Any maser action would of course
significantly increase the possibility of observing
what otherwise is expected to be a very weak
transition.
Finally we should mention that deuterium-frac-
tionation effects lead to a considerable overabun-
dance of H2D+ in models of cold dense clouds
[52]. Unlike H3+, H2D+ has a permanent dipole
moment and hence strong pure-rotational spec-
trum. The search for this spectrum is also a story
of difficult observations and false or tentative
detections, although it does appear now that
definitive observations have been made [53].
6. Conclusion
The era of H3+ astronomy is now truly upon us.
From the original detection of H3+ spectra in the
gas giants, the spectrum has now been observed in
a variety of interstellar environments: dense
molecular clouds, diffuse molecular clouds and a
supernova ejecta. Furthermore H3+, even when
invisible, has been shown to be important for
energy-balance and radiative-transport consider-
ations in both stellar and planetary atmospheres.
These successes has led to suggestions where and
how else one might observe H3+: interesting possi-
bilities are in the atmospheres of ‘giant Jupiters’
orbiting other stars or via maser transitions in the
interstellar medium. However given the history of
this molecule, it would be no surprise if its spec-
trum was also present in places yet to be
anticipated.

arrived at Jupiter to begin its long-term intensive study of the

Jovian magnetic field models have thus far been obtained by

in situ observations are available and where higher-degree and 
higher-order spherical harmonics of the field are least attenuated. 
The limited accuracy of Jovian magnetic field models near 
the surface of the planet has been a source of concern and 
frustration for those attempting to interpret phenomena of 
magnetospheric origin. Two primary examples are the gener- 
ation of decameter wavelength radio emission and Jovian au- 
rorae. The probability of observation of decameter wavelength 
radio emission, first detected in 1955 [Burke and Franklin, 
1955], depends on Io's orbital phase as well as the observer's 
Jovicentric latitude and longitude [Big, , 1964] (for a review, 
see Cart et al. [1983]
Found CASE 2 [Goldstein et al., 1979; Leblanc et al., 1994]. The 
emission one observes is thus very dependent upon the source 
location and the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic 
field in the source region. However, some features of the deca- 
meter emission are still poorly understood, and it is not clear 
whether the emission model or magnetic field model is in 
greater need of improvement [Genova and Aubier, 1987; Gold- 
stein et al., 1979] (see also the review by Goldstein and Goertz

magnetic field models prevented one from associating these

consistent magnetohydrodynamic models [Caudal, 1986; Cau- 
dal and Connemey, 1989] have been utilized to calculate b. For 
numerical convenience we use the former to represent he field 
of the Jovian magnetodisc; both models result in essentially the 
same magnetodisc magnetic field. 
The traditional spherical harmonic expansion of V is given 
by [e.g., Chapman and Barrels, 1940]

for the external field, adjusting the parameters of the magne- 
todisc to reflect the best fit to each data set. A best fitting 
model was then constructed by adding in sequence additional 
eigenvectors, as before. Figure 2 shows the progressive im- 
provement in the RMS residual error for each of these data 
sets that results from the progressive inclusion of additional 
eigenvectors. The RMS residual expected for each data set in 
the absence of systematic errors is indicated in each case with 
the horizontal line. In each case, model residuals are reduced 
to a value close to that expected with the inclusion of 20 or 21 
eigenvectors. We conclude that the IFT footprint observations 
are consistent with any of the three magnetometer data sets 
individually. 
It is more difficult to fit not one but two magnetometer data 
sets in addition to the IFT footprint observations, as is illus- 
trated in Figure 1. This is not unexpected since the model field 
is now constrained along two very different trajectories. Small 
differences in the instrument scale factors will appear as cor- 
related errors along the trajectory, which the inversion will 
attempt to reduce by addition of combinations of higher- 
degree and higher-order spherical harmonics. Similarly, any 
variation of the magnetospheric field between the different 
spacecraft encounters will appear as a correlated error with a 
similar result. This applies equally well to limitations of the 
magnetodisc model used to represent the externally generated 
magnetic field. Spacecraft attitude errors and in some cases 
trajectory and/or timing errors will all fall into this category of 
systematic measurement error. The higher than expected re- 
sidual error shown in Figure 1 is likely due to systematic dif- 
ferences among the magnetometer data sets. Since even small 
systematic errors can result in large errors in the spherical 
harmonic coefficients (illustrated by Connerney [1981]

Found CASE 2 [Conner- 
ney et al., 1993; Kim et al., 1994; Satoh et al., 1996; Clarke et al., 
1996], particularly if allowance is made for repositioning the 
oval in accord with the estimated uncertainty in the internal 
field [Connerney, 1992]. 
Modeled satellite footprints and auroral ovals are shown in 
Figures 3and 4. The auroral footprint traced from 30-R• radial 
distance maps just poleward of the Ganymede footprint raced 
from 15 R•. Current IRTF and HST imagery results in an 
estimated error of observation of about 1 ̧ or 2 ̧ in latitude, so 
it is clear from Figures 3 and 4 that it is very difficult at present 
to distinguish between the Ganymede and auroral footprints. 
This is a result of the magnetodisc geometry and relatively 
small amount of magnetic flux crossing the equator at radial 
distances of15 R• and beyond. However, it is clear that we can

display a similar morphology to the directly excited 
UV emissions [Broadfoot et al., 1979; Clarke et al.,

dent et al., 1996]. The X ray emissions [Metzget et al., 
1983; Waite et al., 1994] have a different morphology, 
with the emissions extending to low latitudes, and the 
thermal IR emissions [Kostiuk et al., 1977; Caldwell et

and the methods of reduction of the UV images [Clarke 
et al., 1995b; Clarke et al., 1996]
Found CASE 2 [Ajello et al., 1998]. The diffuse disk emission is 
dominated by scattered solar continuum at the longer 
wavelengths. The effective wavelength of the nonauro- 
ral light in the FUV images has been estimated by fold- 
ing an IUE small-aperture spectrum of Jupiter's equa- 
tor with the instrument response. For filter F160BW 
we derive a band pass with half power points at 1760 
and 2070 • and a central wavelength of 1900 •, with 
a negligible contribution from light above 2200 •. The 
observed limb darkening has been modeled analytically 
using a Minnaert law formulation with empirical coef- 
ficients [West et al., 1995]

Found CASE 2 [Clarke ½t al., 1996; Ballester ½t al., 1996] are con- 
firmed in these images, and their repetitive nature is 
seen in more detail or covering a longer time period. 
One such feature is the apparent motion of part of the 
northern oval from locations clearly poleward of the ref- 
erence oval while in the local morning sector, to lo- 
cations along the reference oval in the late afternoon 
sector (first reported by Ballester ½t al. (1996)

Found CASE 2 [Gladstone et al., 1998]
Found CASE 2 [Ballester et al., 1996]. As seen in Plates 2-4, 
typical brightnesses of Jupiter's auroral features are sev- 
eral hundred kilo-Rayleighs, so that this "dawn storm" 
emission grew to a level many times brighter than the 
other features, and (on May 31, 1994)
Found CASE 2 [Gdrard 
et al., 1994], and IUE spectra in 1990 indicated the 
presence of an unusually bright auroral emission gener- 
ally on the approaching side of the planet [Livengood 
et al., 1992; Prangd et al., 1993]
Found CASE 2 [Ballester et al., 1996]. 
The locations of magnetic local times are also overplot- 
ted as hash marks in Plate 4, and it can be seen that 
the dawn storm emissions always overlap the location of 
magnetic dawn along the reference oval. Note that there 
is a growing uncertainty in the projection accuracy as 
one nears the dawn limb, as can be seen from the in- 
creasingly pixelized appearance of the auroral emission.

The appearance of the dawn storm emissions along 
the reference oval implies an origin of the storm pro- 
cess in Jupiter's middle magnetosphere. The location 
fixed above magnetic dawn might imply a solar wind 
related process; however, no significant change in solar 
wind activity was found to accompany the May 1994 
storm [Ballester et al., 1996]. The local time depen- 
dence might also reflect the fast rotational dynamics 
of Jupiter's middle magnetosphere, generally at or be- 
yond the orbit of Ganymede and connected to the cur- 
rent sheet [Vasyliunas, 1983], and some internal vari- 
ability leading to the storm onset, a possibility which 
seems more likely. One additional note, with reference 
to Table 2, is that the orbital longitudes of the Galilean 
satellites at the times of the three dawn storms show 
that Io was between 305 and 3250 on each occasion, 
and one or two of the other satellites were within 300 
of dawn in orbital longitude on each occasion. We find 
no particular significance to the repeated location of Io 
on the other side of the planet. The location of one 
or more of the other satellites near local dawn, when 
combined with the apparent magnetic mapping to the 
middle magnetosphere, might, however, indicate some 
causal relation, for example, some sort of "triggering" 
effect provided by the other satellites to the corotating 
magnetodisk. This possibility should be explored with 
more observations to establish if the orbital locations 
of the satellites really determine the onset of the dawn 
storms. 
3.4. Io Footprint 
The Io footprint auroral emission has now been de- 
tected in UV images since May 1994, and in IR H3 + 
emissions since January 1992, so that we have accumu- 
lated a several year record of the locations of this emis- 
sion feature in both the north and south aurora. While 
some longitudinal lead or lag of the emission is expected 
with respect to the instantaneous magnetic footprint 
of the satellite Io, it is believed that the latitude of 
the observed auroral emission in Jupiter's atmosphere 
should indicate the magnetic tracing of the satellite to 
the planet. The observed footprint emission latitudes 
then provide information about the near-Jupiter geom- 
etry of the magnetic field near the polar regions. Un- 
der this assumption, a revised model for Jupiter's mag- 
netic field has been derived [Connerney et al., 1998], 
called the VIP4 model for the input parameters, Voy- 
ager magnetometer data, Io footprint auroral latitudes, 
and Pioneer magnetometer data, with a fourth-order 
fit to these data. We present a comparison of the VIP4 
model with the observed locations of the reference ovals 
and the Io footprint emissions in Figure 2. The 6 Rj 
magnetic field tracing passes through most of the Io 
footprint positions both north and south, as it has been 
constrained to do in the VIP4 model. With this new 
model, the reference ovals give a better fit to the 30 
Rj magnetic tracing than with earlier magnetic field 
models, although there are still significant deviations 
from that model oval. Within the uncertainty in the 
VIP4 model and observations, we estimate that mag- 
netic tracings exceeding 15 R• would give plausible fits 
to the locations of the reference ovals at different longi- 
tudes, implying a similar range of locations in Jupiter's 
magnetosphere where the main auroral processes might 
occur. We note that this range includes the distance at 
which the Galileo magnetometer has found the Jovian 
magnetodisk to abruptly change its thickness [Kivelson 
e! al. , 1997]. 
In the Alfven wing model of Goldreich and Lynden- 
Bell (1969)
Found CASE 2 [Go- 
ertz, 1980; Neubauer, 1980]. In this case, the foot- 
print emission would also be expected to lead the un- 
perturbed magnetic footprint, but with an angle corre- 
sponding to the time delay of the Alfven waves to prop- 
agate down to Jupiter's atmosphere [Belcher, 1987]. 
A hybrid model has also been proposed [Crary and 
Bagenal, 1997] in which the interaction begins as an 
Alfvenic disturbance near Io, and evolves into a steady 
current loop as it moves downstream. Measurements of 
the lead angle of the footprint emissions, and any sys- 
tematic variations with Io's location above or below the 
plasma torus, could potentially discriminate between 
these models for the current flow and interaction be- 
tween Io and Jupiter's ionosphere. 
In Figure 3 we show the apparent lead or lag of the ob- 
served Io footprint auroral emissions with respect to the 
instantaneous magnetic field in both the 06 [Conner- 
ney, 1992]

Found CASE 2 [1997a,b]. We focus on the global effects of 
SRMs in this modeling study. 
The global effects of the chlorine compounds emit- 
ted by the SRMs of the Space Shuttle and Titan IV 
launch vehicles on the stratospheric ozone layer have 
been studied previously using a purely gas phase atmo- 
spheric chemical scheme [Prather et al. 1990] and in- 
cluding heterogeneous reactions on background strato- 
spheric sulfate aerosol particles and polar stratospheric 
clouds [Jackman et al. 1996a]. l•cently, Molina et al. 
[1997]
Found CASE 2 [1997] argue that the alumina particles will probably re- 
main uncoated throughout most of their stratospheric 
residence time and hence promote chlorine activation. 
Several previous studies have considered the issue of 
heterogeneous processes on the SRM-emitted alumina. 
For example, Danilin [1993] and Denison et al. [!994] 
found that ozone in or near the plume was affected in 
only a minor way when heterogeneous reactions on alu- 
mina were included. Jones et al. [1995]
Found CASE 2 [1981] measured submicron alumina particle size dis- 
tributions in a Space Shuttle SRM plume. Cofer et al. 
[1987, 1991] added plume measurements o determine 
the alumina size distributions in the 0.3 to 10 micron 
range. These measurements were combined by Brady 
and Martin [1995]
Found CASE 2 [1995] supply values for both ri and Ai. These values 
indicate that 0.12, 0.08, and 0.80 fraction of the mass 
enters the small, medium, and large particle modes, re- 
spectively. The mode mean radii are given as 0.012, 
0.14, and 0.56 microns, respectively. 
In this work we use a particle size distribution similar 
to that of Brady and Martin [1995]: 
3

Here, we assume that the mode mean radii are con- 
stant in time and the same as in Brady and Martin. The 
values for the exponential prefactors vary in time and 
space depending on the emission rate of the SRM ex- 
hanst and the manner in which alumina is transported 
through the model atmosphere. We assume that the 
mass emitted into each particle mode is consistent with 
the Brady and Martin values. The emitted alumina par- 
ticles are then subject to model transport processes as 
well as gravitational settling. A simple calculation as- 
suming the Stoke's r2 relationship between particle size 
and fall speed [e.g., Rogers, 1979]
Found CASE 2 [1968]. 
3. Steady-State Model Simulations and 
Results 
All simulations were completed with the latest ver- 
sion of the GSFC 2D photochemical nd transport 
model described in Jackman et al. [1996b]. We com- 
puted several mode! simulations and investigated the 
sensitivity of the model results to various assumptions 
about the alumina particles and their effects. A brief 
description of each model simulation is given in Table 
1. The base simulation "A" contained no Space Shuttle 
or Titan IV launches. All other simulations included a 
launch rate of nine Space Shuttle and three Titan IV 
rockets per year as in Jackman et al. [1996a]. The HC1 
stratospheric emissions for this launch scenario are as 
given in Jackman et al. [1996a, Table 1]. 
Other model results have predicted [e.g., Denison et 
al. 1994] that HC1 could be converted to C12 in af- 
terburning reactions in the exhaust plume. Ross et al. 
[1997a] recently confirmed these predictions by measur- 
ing C12 in a Titan IV exhaust plume. The form of chlo- 
rine injected into the stratosphere will make a difference 
for computations of ozone loss in the plume on short 
time scales [e.g., Danilin, 1993]. However, Jones et al. 
[1995]
Found CASE 2 [see Brady et al. 1994]. These 
A1203 emissions can be compared to the HC1 strato- 
spheric emissions by one Space Shuttle and one Titan 
IV rocket launch of 68 and 38 tons, respectively [as used 
in Prather et al. 1990 and Jackman et al. 1996a]
Found CASE 2 [1996a, Table 2]. The reaction C1ONO2+ 
HCI • HNO3 + C12 with a reaction probability of 0.02
