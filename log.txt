Found CASE 2 [30]. For all three cell lines,
the addition of 2.5 lM of ABT-888 inhibited PARP activity by
86% to 92% relative to untreated cells. The presence of
10 lM of ABT-888, led to a further decrease in PARP activity
of 92% to 97% compared to untreated cells. This inhibition
occurred within 30 min and persisted for periods of at least
24 h (Liu SK, Coackley C, Bristow RG, unpublished data)

reports [22,37], we noted no significant change in the per-
centage of apoptotic H1299 or DU145 cells in the presence
or absence of ABT-888, indicating that under these treat-
ment conditions, PARP inhibition did not influence the apop-
totic pathway in these cell lines (Liu SK, Coackley C, Bristow
