# "CITAL" - PDF Citation Analyzer
"CITAL" can perform multiple types of contextual analysis.  
It can find almost every form of in text-citation, check if a paper is referenced in another one, extract titles,
arrange PDF files based on different specifications, and more.  
  
Used by researchers at top US schools for a co-citation study (checking if a pair of papers are cited in the same in-text citation given a set of papers). More that **1 million** papers were analyzed.
